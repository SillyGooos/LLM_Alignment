II. it is not possible to tell. III. no.", "response": "According to the premise, \"The techniques for ensuring sufficient comparability and quality and for aggregating the information are what constitute the cumulative part of the methodology.\" This statement indicates that there are existing techniques in place as part of the cumulative methodology that are designed to ensure sufficient comparability and quality, as well as aggregation of information.\n\nNow, let's consider the hypothesis, \"There is a lack of techniques for sufficient comparability.\" This hypothesis posits that there may be an absence or insufficiency of techniques focused on comparability. In order to determine whether the premise entails this hypothesis, we must analyze if accepting the truth of the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the hypothesis.\n\nUpon careful analysis, it becomes clear that the premise acknowledges the existence of techniques for sufficient comparability and quality. It states that these techniques form a crucial part of the cumulative methodology, which implies that they are integral to the process being discussed. Therefore, since the premise claims the presence of techniques for ensuring sufficient comparability, it actually contradicts the hypothesis, which suggests a lack of such techniques.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer to the question of whether the premise entails the hypothesis \"There is a lack of techniques for sufficient comparability\" is III. no. The premise does not support the hypothesis, and in fact, it provides evidence against it by stating that the techniques for sufficient comparability exist and are significant components of the cumulative methodology.", "token_count": 381}

Once an esteemed architect, Andre had a beautiful family, an ample house, and all the comforts of life. However, an unexpected incident turned everything upside down. Andre's wife, Isabelle, suffered a severe illness which required expensive treatments. To pay for her medical bills, he had to surrender all their savings and the couple ended up drowning in debt.\n\nThe movie opens to present this dire picture. Andre is left with a debt of 20,000 euros and threats from lenders are piling up. He tries to retrieve his previous life by working hard in his field, but the architectural market is tough and unforgiving, and his situation remains more or less the same.\n\nOne day, while drowning his sorrows in a glass of French wine at a local bistro, Andre overhears a conversation about a \"secret architectural competition\" with a grand prize of 20,000 Euros. Despite his initial skepticism, Andre is desperate and decides to give it a shot.\n\nThe middle of the movie revolves around Andre's struggles as he throws himself back into the world of architecture. He battles his inner demons of self-doubt and despondency, works day and night, barely sleeps, and almost forgets to eat. He faces fierce competition, ruthless competitors, as well as the judgmental eyes of the world who see him as a 'has been.' \n\nAlong his journey, he finds an unlikely friend in Henri, a struggling young graphic-designer who admires Andre's never-give-up spirit and helps him with the competition designs. Despite the bleak situation, the friendship with Henri adds an element of warmth and hope to Andre's life.\n\nAs the climax unfolds, Andre's designs are selected among the top contenders. However, an internal politics rocking the organizer's office threatens to eliminate Andre unfairly from the competition. Henri find out about this ploy and helps Andre expose the scandal, leading to a tense confrontation where Andre makes a passionate speech about integrity and the true spirit of architecture.\n\nAfter a series of nail-biting events, the jury is swayed by Andre's honesty, integrity, his passionate love for architecture, and his heart-melting designs. Overcoming all the odds, Andre wins the competition and the coveted prize of 20,000 euros.\n\nIn the end, Andre pays off his debts, and with the leftover money, he starts a collaborative architectural firm with Henri, using their victory's wave. Isabelle's health stabilizes with the return of their financial stability.\n\n\"20,000 Chances\" is a movie about resilience, second chances, and the capacity of the human spirit to bounce back even in the face of tremendous adversities. Andre's story serves as a beacon of hope that it's never too late to fight back, to dream again, and to reshape one's destiny. The rollercoaster journey - from Andre's personal lows to his ultimate triumph - is a cinematic spectacle that will capture the audience's heart and provide them with a generous dose of inspiration.", "token_count": 512}

Born on January 17, 1706, in Boston, Massachusetts, he was 70 years old when the Declaration was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. \n\nBenjamin Franklin was a polymath, who contributed significantly to the fields of science, writing, and politics. Among his many accomplishments, he is best known for his experiments with electricity, his role in drafting the U.S. Constitution, and his influence as a founding father of the United States. His inventions, such as the lightning rod and the bifocals, greatly impacted society at that time and even today.\n\nIn 1729, Franklin moved to Philadelphia, where he started a printing business and eventually published the well-known \"Poor Richard's Almanack.\" He also founded several civic organizations, such as the Library Company of Philadelphia (America's first lending library) and the American Philosophical Society. He dedicated much of his life to public service, holding multiple positions such as Postmaster General of the colonies and the President of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society.\n\nFranklin was an early and passionate advocate for colonial unity and independence. As a member of the Continental Congress, he was among the five individuals (including Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston) appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence in 1776.\n\nFrom 1776 to 1785, Franklin served as the U.S. envoy to France, where he played a significant role in building French support for the American Revolution. He helped negotiate the Treaty of Alliance (1778) and the Treaty of Paris (1783) that ended the war.\n\nUpon returning to the U.S., Franklin was elected as a member of the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and played a crucial role in shaping the U.S. Constitution.

Despite the financial turmoil, this ancient city has evolved into a haven for the creative, adventurous, and sophisticated crowd, providing a breath of fresh air in an otherwise grim situation. In this article, we explore how Athens has risen above the challenges and emerged as a destination for the modern, urban lifestyle.\n\nThe Economic Crisis and Athens \n\nWhen the global financial crisis hit in 2008, Greece, already tangled in high levels of debt, found itself at the epicenter of the European economic turmoil. From sky-high unemployment rates to relentless austerity measures, Greek citizens faced challenging times, with the capital city of Athens becoming the symbol of this suffering. The economic collapse that ensued resulted in widespread hardship and social disillusionment.\n\nComing of Age: A New Movement Emerges \n\nIn the face of adversity, the Athenian spirit of resilience coupled with the enterprising mindset of its people birthed a cultural renaissance. Athens' young entrepreneurs, designers, and artists turned a dire economic situation into an opportunity to forge a dynamic and creative path. Out of the ashes of the economic disaster rose a lifestyle district that rivaled those of other global cities such as New York, London, and Paris.\n\nAthens' Revitalized Cityscape \n\nThe transformation of Athens can be witnessed in its bustling cityscape, characterized by fashionable cafes, eclectic bars, contemporary art galleries, and vibrant street art. These trendy hotspots, frequented by fashion-conscious Athenians and tourists alike, have breathed new life into the city's once-drab streets.\n\nThe city's thriving culinary scene is another testament to Athens' rejuvenation. Local chefs meld traditional Greek cuisine with innovative twists, resulting in a gastronomic boom that tantalizes both taste buds and helps set the city apart as an emerging food lover’s destination.\n\nCocktail Bars and Nightlife\n\nAthens' nightlife has flourished in lockstep with the city's rejuvenation, with an eclectic mix of bars and clubs catering to all tastes. From intimate rooftop bars that promise patrons a taste of unparalleled romanticism, to underground speakeasies oozing mystery and allure, the city's late-night scene continues to leave visitors dazzled.\n\nAnd though Athens’ nightlife may be steeped in a relaxed Mediterranean ambience, its rich offerings promise to outdo those of many international metropolitan cities.\n\nThe Effects of the Transformation \n\nThe metamorphosis of Athens from a city ravaged by the economic crisis to a vibrant and trendy metropolis has had profound socio-economic implications. As more people flock to the city's fashionable establishments, a sense of solidarity emerges among the afflicted, allowing Athenians to rebuild their lives and their city in style and elegance.\n\nMoreover, the renewed interest in the city has propelled tourism, infusing much-needed funds into the beleaguered economy. As a result, new jobs have been created, providing opportunities for the unemployed young Athenians – the early architects behind the reimagined city.\n\nIn Conclusion \n\nIn the face of an economic catastrophe, Athens has risen, phoenix-like, from the financial wreckage of its recent past. The creative transformations in the city's culinary, nightlife, and art scenes have propelled this ancient urban center into the modern age, positioning it as a vibrant destination for young and stylish patrons.\n\nWith its intoxicating mixture of history, culture, and cutting-edge creativity, Athens now stands as a testament to the indomitable human spirit, offering a rich and satisfying experience for locals and tourists alike to savor.", "token_count": 512}

The building was sold in 1549 by Buonaccorso Pitti, a descendant of Luca Pitti, to Eleonora di Toledo.  Raised at the luxurious court of Naples, Eleonora was the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici of Tuscany, later the Grand Duke.  On moving into the palace, Cosimo had Vasari enlarge the structure to fit his tastes; the palace was more than doubled by the addition of a new block along the rear.  Vasari also built the Vasari Corridor, an above-ground walkway from Cosimo's old palace and the seat of government, the Palazzo Vecchio, through the Uffizi, above the Ponte Vecchio to the Palazzo Pitti. This enabled the Grand Duke and his family to move easily and safely from their official residence to the Palazzo Pitti. Initially the Palazzo Pitti was used mostly for lodging official guests and for occasional functions of the court, while the Medicis' principal residence remained the Palazzo Vecchio. It was not until the reign of Eleonora's son Francesco I and his wife Johanna of Austria that the palazzo was occupied on a permanent basis and became home to the Medicis' art collection.Land on the Boboli hill at the rear of the palazzo was acquired in order to create a large formal park and gardens, today known as the Boboli Gardens. The landscape architect employed for this was the Medici court artist Niccolò Tribolo, who died the following year; he was quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati. The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre, behind the corps de logis of the palazzo. The first play recorded as performed there was Andria by Terence in 1476. It was followed by many classically inspired plays of Florentine playwrights such as Giovan Battista Cini. Performed for the amusement of the cultivated Medici court, they featured elaborate sets designed by the court architect Baldassarre Lanci.\nAnswer:", "response": "Palazzo Pitti", "token_count": 502}

According to this sentence, he has also known Michael Phelps from childhood.\n\nIn the second sentence, it is mentioned that the person was trained by César Cielo, who is described as the American swimmer coach ‘Bob Bowman’. Here, it seems as though Bob Bowman and César Cielo are being confused with each other or are being misidentified. Bob Bowman is actually the renowned coach of Michael Phelps, not a swimmer himself. Furthermore, according to the sentence, this training occurred at the University of Michigan. The sentence also establishes that the person has been friends with Michael Phelps since childhood.\n\nAlthough there is an attempt to relay the same set of information in both sentences, there are crucial differences in their conveyance of these details that prevent them from being considered direct paraphrases of each other. As such, we can consider them semantically different, not complete paraphrases. Important distinctions lie in the identities and roles of César Cielo and Bob Bowman, as the first sentence implicitly recognizes Bob Bowman as an individual separate from César Cielo, whereas the second sentence somehow mixes up their identities.\n\nA true paraphrase ensures that the exact same concept or message is communicated, despite changes to the structure or wording of the sentence. In this case, there are significant differences in the conveyed details about both César Cielo and Bob Bowman between the two sentences.\n\nMoreover, paraphrasing typically involves rewording or rephrasing the entire sentence, rather than just rearranging the words or switching around a few phrases. Therefore, rearranging the words or phrases within the same sentence without altering its meaning significantly can be classified as paraphrasing. However, if the contextual sense alters due to the rearrangement, then the sentences cannot be classified as paraphrases of each other. In this particular instance, the altered arrangement of details in the second sentence resulted in a change in implied identities of César Cielo and Bob Bowman; hence, this is not a case of true paraphrasing.", "token_count": 512}

High flying: The original SpaceShipTwo (above) was destroyed in a tragic crash on Friday. The team has already spent a good two years hard at work in the company's assembly facility building the ship, dubbed SpaceShipTwo Serial No. 2, which will now replace the destroyed version. According to Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides, this new ship could be tested in as soon as six months. 'There was no question it was a tragic setback, but it's one from which we can recover,' said Whitesides. 'With Serial No. 2, we'll be putting a stronger, even better ship into initial commercial service and I think we'll be able to get back into test flights soon and carry forward.' In the meantime, the team at Virgin will still be able to fly and test their mother ship WhiteKnightTwo, as federal investigators look into the cause of Friday's deadly crash. Back to the beginning: a photo from 2008 shows the original SpaceShipTwo being built (above) Tragic end: The crash on Friday killed pilot Michael Alsbury (above) That crash left pilot Michael Alsbury, 39, dead, and his co-pilot, Peter Siebold, injured. Siebold somehow managed to escape the crash with nothing more than a broken shoulder, this after falling 50,000 feet with nothing but a parachute. He was discharged from the hospital on Monday. The investigation into what caused the crash could take up to a year.\n\nWhat are highlight points for this article?", "response": "1.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump, after a tactical retreat this week on immigration policy, demonstrated Friday that there is no strategic shift to his overall tough approach to those attempting to illegally enter the country, and vowing to \"end the immigration crisis, once and for all.\" U.S. immigration laws, Trump declared, are \"the weakest in the history of the world.\" Trump made the remarks in an auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House, where he presided over an event with so-called \"Angel Families,\" those who have had relatives killed by people who entered the country illegally. \"Your loss will not have been in vain,\" the president told the families, who held large photos of their slain relatives. \"We will secure our borders … the word will get out. Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\" Trump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \"zero tolerence\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children. Question: After this story, the Angel Families probably still: Answer:\nOptions are:\n[A]. feel immigrants are less likely to commit a crime.\n[B]. condemn Trump for the zero tolerance policy.\n[C]. condemn the media for ignoring the stories of victims.\n[D]. not enough information.\nAnswer:", "response": "[C]. condemn the media for ignoring the stories of victims.", "token_count": 480}

Getty \n  \n \"Mankind inhabits this Earth subject to geological consent,\" says Simon Winchester in Newsweek. And, as demonstrated by the earthquake and resulting tsunami that brought Japan to its knees, this consent \"can be withdrawn at any time.\" Japan sits \"at the junction of a web of tectonic-plate boundaries that make it more peculiarly vulnerable to ground-shaking episodes than almost anywhere else.\" But the disaster there can't be viewed in isolation. When one side of a tectonic plate shifts, \"the Earth becomes like a great brass bell, which when struck by an enormous hammer blow on one side sets to vibrating and ringing from all over.\" This can trigger catastrophe on faraway edges of the same great plate, which could be bad news for California. Here, an excerpt: \n  \n There was a horrifically destructive Pacific earthquake in New Zealand on Feb. 22, and an even more violent magnitude-8.8 event in Chile almost exactly a year before. All three phenomena involved more or less the same family of circum-Pacific fault lines and plate boundaries.... Now there have been catastrophic events at three corners of the Pacific Plate — one in the Northwest, on Friday; one in the Southwest, last month; one in the Southeast, last year. \n  \n  \n  \n That leaves just one corner unaffected — the Northeast. And the fault line in the northeast of the Pacific Plate is the San Andreas Fault, underpinning the city of San Francisco. ... \n  \n  \n  \n All know that the San Andreas Fault is due to rupture one day — it last did so in 1906, and strains have built beneath it to a barely tolerable level. To rupture again, with unimaginable consequences for the millions who live above it, some triggering event has to occur. Now three events have occurred that might all be regarded as triggering events. There are in consequence a lot of thoughtful people in the American West who are very nervous indeed — wondering, as they often must do, whether the consent that permits them to inhabit so pleasant a place might be about to be withdrawn, sooner than they have supposed. \n  \n  \n  \n Read the full article at Newsweek. |||||  \n  \n Simon Winchester, an author and expert on earthquakes, made a disturbing connection between the epic earthquake and tsunami in Japan and recent devastating quakes in New Zealand and Chile, saying the three events were in three corners of a square in the Pacific some call the “Ring of Fire.” The fourth corner is California and the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Winchester told TODAY‘s Meredith Vieira a massive event along the San Andreas Fault in California is “inevitable.” \n  \n  \n  \n “It’s becoming abundantly clear that these major earthquakes…tend to occur in clusters,” Winchester said. “A cluster seems to have happened in the last year in the Pacific plate.” Winchester said the even more concerning than a quake along the San Andreas Fault would be an earthquake along the Cascadia Fault, which is underwater along Northern California, Oregon and Washington. A quake there could trigger a tsunami. \n  \n Watch the interview here, from NBC News: \n  \n Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com |||||", "response": "In an article by Simon Winchester in Newsweek, he highlights the connections between recent earthquakes in Japan, New Zealand, and Chile, stating that they occurred in three corners of the Pacific's \"Ring of Fire\".

His appointment to that post, which has senior administrative, staff and policy responsibilities, followed a several-year tenure as Reuters's editor in chief. No successor was named, and Mr. Reupke's duties will be split among three other senior Reuters executives, the company said. In a telephone interview, Mr. Reupke said his departure was for \"personal reasons,\" which he declined to specify. \"There is no business reason for my departure,\" nor any disagreement over policy, he added. He also rejected reports that his departure stemmed from disappointment the general manager's post hadn't also led to a board directorship at the London-based news organization. Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters's eight-person executive committee who didn't also serve on the company's board of directors. \"If I were choosing the people of tomorrow, I would have chosen the people who are now on the board,\" he said. A Reuters spokesman said the departure reflects \"no change in strategy or profits.\" Mark Shepperd, an analyst at UBS Philips & Drew in London, said, \"I suspect (the departure) will be fairly irrelevant for the company.

I'll start by clarifying what cannabis oil is, then I'll analyze the studies conducted on the potential of cannabis oil in curing cancer.\n\nStep 1: Defining Cannabis Oil - Cannabis oil is a substance extracted from the cannabis plant by steam distillation. It is a type of cannabinoid, and it's thought to have a wide variety of health benefits. \n\nStep 2: Understanding Cancer - Cancer is not a single disease but a collection of related diseases. It is a complex and potentially fatal disease that is primarily caused through environmental factors that mutate genes encoding important cell-regulatory proteins.\n\nStep 3: Using Cannabis Oil for Cancer Treatment - As an AI, I don't have opinions, but I can provide information from research. Currently, there is no concrete scientific evidence to suggest that cannabis oil or any other form of cannabis can cure cancer. Some studies have suggested that certain cannabinoids may slow growth and reduce spread of some forms of cancer, but these studies are preliminary.\n\nNow, to the question about indica plant-derived cannabis oil:\n\nStep 4: Understanding Cannabis Indica - Cannabis Indica is a subspecies of Cannabis sativa, and it's thought to have originated from the Hindu Kush region near Afghanistan. Like all types of cannabis, it contains multiple cannabinoids.\n\nStep 5: Indica Cannabis Oil and Cancer - The existing research on cannabis and cancer does not differentiate between Indica, Sativa, or hybrid strains. Therefore, claims that Indica cannabis oil specifically can cure cancer are not currently supported by scientific evidence.\n\nConclusion: In answering the question, \"Would the answer to these two questions be the same?\" - Yes, the answer is the same for both. According to the current medical and scientific consensus, while cannabis and its derivatives may show promise in helping to manage symptoms and side effects of cancer and cancer treatment, there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that it can cure cancer. It's important for anyone considering such treatments to discuss them with their healthcare provider to make an informed decision.", "token_count": 485}

Is the following statement true?\n\"Astronauts did not land on the moon.\"", "response": "To determine if the statement \"Astronauts did not land on the moon\" is true, we need to examine the available evidence and determine its credibility. Let's go through this step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: Research the Apollo Moon Missions\nThe Apollo program, conducted by NASA, sent astronauts to the moon from 1969 to 1972. Apollo 11 was the first mission to successfully land on the moon in July 1969, with astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins aboard the spacecraft. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the lunar surface.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the Evidence\nEvidence supporting the moon landings includes photos and videos taken during the missions, rock samples collected from the lunar surface, ongoing communication between the astronauts and mission control in Houston, and testimony from numerous eyewitnesses. Many experts in the fields of astronomy, geology, and physics have confirmed the authenticity of these materials.\n\nStep 3: Address Conspiracy Theories\nDespite the abundant evidence, some people still believe that the moon landings were a hoax. Conspiracy theories usually rely on a combination of misinterpretations, selective evidence presentation, and discrediting of authentic evidence. However, no credible evidence supports the claim that the moon landings were faked.\n\nConclusion:\nGiven the overwhelming evidence from the Apollo missions, expert analysis, and the lack of credible alternative explanations, the statement \"Astronauts did not land on the moon\" is false. Astronauts did indeed land on the moon during the Apollo missions, beginning with Apollo 11 in 1969.", "token_count": 381}

Here's a question for you:\n\nQuestion: What were the main causes of World War I and what event triggered its outbreak?\n\nDetailed Answer: World War I had multiple, complex causes, but four main factors contributed to the tensions that ultimately led to the conflict. These factors include:\n\n1. Mutual Defense Alliances: Many countries in Europe formed alliances to bolster their protection and ensure mutual support in case of an attack. The major alliances during this time were the Triple Entente, consisting of France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, and the Triple Alliance with Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. These alliances turned local disputes into larger, international confrontations as countries were obligated to defend their allies.\n\n2. Imperialism: European powers competed for territory, wealth, and influence around the globe, particularly in Africa and Asia. This competition fueled rivalries, distrust, and a scramble for resources, contributing to an atmosphere of uncertainty and tension.\n\n3. Militarism: The countries involved in WWI built up their military power, embracing the idea that a strong military force was crucial to a nation's well-being. This arms race, combined with aggressive military strategies, made the nations more likely to resort to war to settle disputes or conflicts.\n\n4. Nationalism: Intense pride in one's country and the belief that one's nation is superior to others led to the further escalation of tensions. This idea was particularly potent in the Balkans, where multiple ethnic groups desired independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nThe event that ultimately triggered the outbreak of World War I was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on June 28, 1914. The assassination took place in Sarajevo during the Archduke's visit to the city. Gavrilo Princip, a member of the Serbian nationalist secret society called the Black Hand, carried out the assassination. Following the assassination, a complex web of diplomatic maneuvering and ultimatums ensued, culminating in Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Serbia on July 28, 1914. Due to the mutual defense alliances in place, other European powers were drawn into the conflict, leading to a full-scale war that lasted until November 11, 1918.", "token_count": 487}

They were as perfect in their parts as Davis was in hers - they just didn't have as much to do. Some of the reviewers felt that the book was so much better - it was but to give the film it's due, to condense a 600 page book down to 83 minutes is no mean feat. The first part of the book didn't even make it to the screen - it told of Phillip's childhood, then moved to Germany and Paris, where Phillip had gone to try to make good as an artist. It also chronicles his first romance - with Fanny Price, who kills herself when she realises Phillip cannot return her feelings of love. It is a wonderful book but rambling and I think that anyone who does not think too highly of the film should read the book and will realise how good the film is.\n\nAfter realising that he will only ever be a mediocre painter, Phillip Carey (Leslie Howard) comes back to England hoping to take up medicine. When out at a tearoom he meets a sullen waitress, Mildred (Bette Davis). Even though she has no interest in him and basically treats him like dirt, Phillip is obsessed. It is so hard to watch his efforts at trying to find any civility in this vicious shrew. In one scene she promises to meet him in a second class railway waiting room, when they almost miss each other, she berates him with \"why would I wait in a second class waiting room when there is a first class one available\". You just want to shake him. The only time she is pleasant to him is when she tells him she is going to marry another man, a coarse sales- man, Emile Miller (Alan Hale). With Mildred out of the picture, he meets Nora (Kay Johnson) a lovely woman, who writes romantic novels under a male pseudonym. She jokes about the popularity the books enjoy among servants (in the novel he had seen Mildred reading them.) Nora gives Phillip all the love and confidence he needs but he is incapable of returning her love. When Mildred returns (Miller didn't marry her and she is having a baby), of course he takes care of her and helps her with the baby (in the film it is treated as an object - always called \"baby\", never given a name or gender) - she repays him by running off with his best friend.\n\nAt the hospital he meets Sally Athelny (Frances Dee) who is visiting her sick father. He begins to visit her home and for the first time in his life gets a sense of family. Then surprise! surprise! Mildred returns like a bad penny and surprise! Philip takes her in. But he has changed and feels only disgust when she tries to show gratitude the only way she knows how. Then follows one of the most vicious, verbal fights on film with phrases such as \"you cad, you dirty swine\", \"I only kissed you because you begged me\" and \"when you went I wiped my mouth, I WIPED MY MOUTH\"!!! In the book a lot of Mildred's stock phrases such as \"you're a gentleman in every sense of the word\", \"I don't mind\", and \"Mr. High and Mighty\" were associated with prostitutes and when Phillip meets her for the first time he is struck by that.\n\nThe end of the film shows Phillip (being truly free of Mildred in the only way possible) now free to love Sally. Again in the book Sally tells Phillip that she thinks she is having a baby but that just makes him more sure of his love. That ending, like Mildred's \"sickness\" could not be in the film - even a pre-code one.\n\nKay Johnson was always called on to play sensible, believable women - which she played to perfection as she was obviously sensible herself. Her Nora was the woman Philip should have stayed with. Frances Dee was one of the most beautiful of screen ingenues. She was obviously being groomed for stardom with some roles that proved she was not just a pretty face (\"The Silver Cord\" and \"Blood Money\") but when she married Joel McCrea her career started to peter out. Her Sally did not push her talent to the limits. Apparently Leslie Howard was not very helpful to Bette Davis on the set - he was annoyed that an English actress was not given the part. He used to throw her her lines \"whilst reading a book off camera\". He did start to take an interest when a newspaper reported \"the kid was running away with the picture\"!!!\n\nHighly, Highly Recommended.", "response": "The sentiment of this text is positive.

I waited and watched a couple of squirrels fight over a small treasure in the bushes. The door opened. \"Dingo.\" \"Hey, Luna.\" Her job as Rick's assistant was to take care of his place while he was out being a rock star. She made sure all his bills were paid, his animals were fed, and that the subsequent fallout from any parties she might have in his absence didn't leave any lasting damage. She was pretty by most standards, gorgeous by others. Short with a tight schoolgirl body and raven hair that teased her avian shoulders. But by whatever standard, her beauty was like a rare and exotic bird she kept caged behind the bars of her perfect teeth. As soon as she opened her mouth it flew away.

{"id": "example_10007", "prompt": "Summarize this article:\n\nHow far is it between the top and bottom wires? How far is it around? If you are working with a paneled shade, simply take the measurement of each panel; if you are working with a circular shade, measure the circumference (3.14 x diameter). This is necessary to find out how long and wide your strips of fabric need to be and the amount that will cover your entire shade. This is where the shade becomes all your own. Use one style of material for a battered, distressed look or use all types of coordinating colors and patterns. Just make sure they're long enough!  Add one extra inch for the seam allowance. This is needed to wrap around the wire frame.  If your lamp is 20\" (51 cm) around, make sure you have fabric that, in total, amounts to at least 22\" (56 cm) wide. You need adequate overlap to keep the wire frame from showing. Of course, greater overlap than that is always safe, too. If each strip of fabric is 2\" (5 cm) across, have at least 11 strips of fabric ready. This ensures that it stays neat, doesn't fray, and looks professional. The edges will only be seen from the inside of your lamp. If you're pressed for time or simply can't be bothered, a simple trim is fine. Using your 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) on either side, affix the strip to the top of the shade with a staple gun, hot glue gun, or needle and thread. Repeat for the bottom.  If you use a hot glue gun and glue the material to the wire, you will not be able to gather the fabric when it's finished. If you use a staple gun, it's a good idea to add decorative trim around the top and bottom to obscure those tiny metallic lines from view. You can gather the material together if you stapled or used a needle and thread. Adjust the material to achieve the look you want. Beads, tassles, or extra ribbon can be added onto the top and bottom of your shade to hide any less-than-perfect areas or simply to add more flair.", "response": "The article discusses the process of measuring and creating a custom lampshade using fabric strips. To determine the measurements, one should measure the distance between the top and bottom wires of the lampshade and the circumference if it's circular. This is essential to know the required length and width of the fabric strips.\n\nThe lampshade's design can vary according to personal preference, from a distressed look with one material to a mix of coordinating colors and patterns. Always add an extra inch for the seam allowance, ensuring adequate overlap to hide the wireframe. For instance, if a lamp is 20 inches around, a fabric width of at least 22 inches is needed. If each fabric strip is 2 inches wide, prepare at least 11 strips.\n\nTo maintain a neat and professional appearance, the edges of the fabric can be trimmed. To affix the fabric strips to the lampshade, use a staple gun, hot glue gun, or needle and thread. Keep in mind that if a hot glue gun is used, it is not possible to gather the fabric afterwards. To hide any staples, decorative trim can be added around the top and bottom of the lampshade.\n\nAdjust the material based on the desired look, and consider additional embellishments such as beads, tassels, or extra ribbon to hide any imperfections or add flair. Overall, the goal is to create a personalized lampshade with a professional finish and appearance according to one's taste and style.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_9934", "prompt": "Question: In humans, the medical condition kyphosis affects which part of the body?\nAnswer:", "response": "Kyphosis is a medical condition that affects the human spine, specifically the thoracic region, which is the upper and middle part of the back. This condition is characterized by an exaggerated forward rounding or curvature of the spine, often referred to as a \"humpback\" or \"dowager's hump\" appearance. In a healthy spine, there is a natural curve in the thoracic region that allows for flexibility, balance, and shock absorption. However, when this curvature becomes more pronounced than normal, it results in kyphosis.\n\nThere are several types and causes of kyphosis, including:\n\n1. Postural kyphosis: This is the most common form of kyphosis, often seen in adolescents and young adults, and is primarily caused by poor posture and slouching. In most cases, it is mild and can be corrected through physical therapy and practicing good posture.\n\n2. Scheuermann's kyphosis: This type of kyphosis occurs in adolescents during growth spurts and is thought to be caused by abnormal growth of the vertebrae, leading to a more rigid and exaggerated curvature. Bracing or surgical intervention may be required in severe cases.\n\n3. Congenital kyphosis: This rare form of kyphosis is present at birth and is caused by abnormal development of the spinal column during pregnancy. Depending on the severity, infants may require surgical intervention to prevent complications and developmental issues.\n\n4. Osteoporosis-related kyphosis: As people age, their bone density can decrease, resulting in osteoporosis. This can lead to compression fractures in the vertebrae, causing the spine to curve forward progressively. Treatment often includes medications to improve bone density and bracing to support the spine.\n\n5. Degenerative kyphosis: This form of kyphosis results from wear and tear on the spine over time due to aging or conditions like arthritis that cause gradual degeneration of the intervertebral discs and facet joints. Treatment varies depending on the severity and may include pain management, physical therapy, or surgery.\n\nKyphosis can have various effects on the body, ranging from mild discomfort and cosmetic concerns to more severe issues like chronic pain, reduced mobility, and difficulty breathing. Treatment for kyphosis is primarily based on the severity of the condition and the underlying cause. In mild cases, conservative treatment options like physical therapy, postural training, and pain management are often sufficient. In more severe cases or when the condition is progressive, more aggressive treatments such as bracing or surgical intervention may be necessary.\n\nDiagnosis of kyphosis typically involves a thorough physical examination, assessment of medical history, and imaging tests like X-rays, CT scans, or MRI to evaluate the degree of curvature and potential causes. Early detection and intervention are essential for addressing the underlying issues and preventing long-term complications that can be associated with this spinal deformity.", "token_count": 512}

Brian Blackman, 73, was suffering from Parkinson’s disease and died in January 2011. A friend said it had a huge impact on his son, who tragically had been caught in traffic and unable make it to his father’s bedside to be with him as he died. It was against this emotional backdrop of regret and grief that the commando deployed to Afghanistan. Those close to him believe this played a part in the ‘moment of madness’ that ended in the execution of a Taliban fighter – and murder conviction more than two years later. Scroll down for video. Emotional: Alexander Blackman with his wheelchair-bound father Brian who died shortly before his tour of duty. Footage: The incident in which Blackman killed a Taliban militant was caught on camera by another Marine. Ironically, Blackman was a model soldier, a war hero with an exceptional record who had served in a number of conflicts. He proved his courage on six gruelling tours of duty in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. And in 2001 he was part of the hunt for Bin Laden. He was among Marines flown in to help Special Forces as they fought Al Qaeda gunmen in Bora Bora. Blackman’s closest brush with death came on his tour to Iraq, when he miraculously survived being hit by a grenade during the assault on Basra. Identified: Sergeant Alexander Blackman has been revealed as the Royal Marine who was last month convicted a murdering an Afghan insurgent. Fighting had been intense, with an. officer describing the area as a scene from Dante’s Inferno. While. leading the assault on Basra, Iraq’s second city in a military vehicle,. his rucksack containing ammunition, water and rations was hit by the. warhead of a rocket propelled grenade in an ambush on his vehicle. Marines dived for cover as bullets and RPGs raining down on them, and one rocket smashed into his kit bag diverting it just past his head while bullets burst around them. After the attack, his fellow commandos could not believe that Blackman had not been killed. Despite the difficult campaign – which saw Marines locked in some of the fiercest fighting experienced by British forces – his combat report is said to have been ‘exemplary’ and he was recommended for promotion. His family in Brighton – his father, a former porter and lorry driver, his mother Frances, 74, a former hairdresser, brother and two sisters knew his love of the Marines and the lifestyle they offered. Blackman, a keen cyclist, runner and golfer, excelled while studying sports and physical education at Lewes Tertiary College in East Sussex. He had ambitions of representing Great Britain at canoeing until, aged 17, he was knocked down by a car while cycling. Desperate to challenge himself, he enlisted in the Royal Marines in 1998, passing the arduous tests with flying colours. Tours of Northern Ireland were followed by training in the US and Oman, and in November 2007 he deployed to southern Afghanistan. After returning from that tour he married Claire Warner, 38, an assistant director of operations with the National Trust in Somerset and Gloucestershire, and they settled in Taunton. Incident: The footage filmed by Marine B's helmet camera formed part of the court martial hearing. Revealed: Footage of the incident with Blackman's face uncensored has just been released for the first time. Highly regarded by senior officers,. Blackman had joined 42 Commando and J [Juliet] Company, known for its. discipline, fortitude and bravery – and members were tested to the full. during their six-month spring tour in spring 2011. He had previously seen some action in Afghanistan during the quieter winter months. But this deployment – later named the ‘Tour from hell’ by his colleagues – them attacked almost daily. Despite this hostility, the imposing 6ft 3in Blackman was credited with fostering ‘hearts and minds’ of the local population and helping oversee projects such as the building of a school. But the gruelling impact of losing friends and colleagues was to take its toll. During the proceedings leading up to his conviction for murder, Blackman said around 20 of his friends had been killed or maimed during the tour, including a popular young officer and a marine who had previously won a Military Cross for courage under fire. Film: The Marine could be heard quoting Shakespeare as he shot the Taliban prisoner. Trauma: Friends of Blackman have blamed the incident on the horrors he experienced while on duty. He said other comrades had suffered ‘life-changing’ injuries and described the effect the deaths had on commandos after the body parts of friends were hung in trees by insurgents. ‘It’s not a nice thing for the lads,’ he said. ‘Close friends they have lived with have been killed and parts of their bodies are displayed as a kind of trophy for the world to see.’ The Marines returned home as heroes, with Blackman earmarked for promotion to Colour Sergeant.

Look for a flat, clear area away from any overhanging branches or flammable materials. An existing fire pit or a circle of rocks can be a good spot for containing the fire.\n\nStep 2: Prepare the fire pit. If there isn't an existing fire pit, create a small depression in the ground and surround it with rocks. This will help contain the fire and provide a barrier from wind.\n\nStep 3: Arrange the materials. Start by placing a small pile of dry leaves or tinder in the center of the fire pit. These materials catch fire easily and will act as the base for the campfire.\n\nStep 4: Build a structure. Place the small twigs in a teepee shape over the tinder. Make sure to leave an opening for the air and to light the fire. Then, place the larger sticks around the small twigs, also in a teepee shape. Finally, stack the logs around the sticks, ensuring that they have good contact with the other materials to help the fire spread.\n\nStep 5: Light the fire. Using matches or a lighter, ignite the tinder in the center of the structure. The flames will spread from the tinder to the twigs, then the sticks, and eventually the logs. Blow gently on the fire if it needs more oxygen to grow.\n\nStep 6: Maintain the fire. Add more wood when necessary, and reposition logs if they're not burning evenly. Remember to exercise caution when handling the fire. Always keep a safe distance and have a source of water nearby in case of emergencies.\n\nIn summary, the next steps in starting a campfire are finding a suitable location, preparing the fire pit, arranging the materials, building a structure, lighting the fire, and maintaining it safely.", "token_count": 461}

Two years earlier, in the small town of Salem's Lot (formally known as Jerusalem's Lot) in Maine in the United States, Ben Mears, an author, has returned to the town after a long absence to write a book about the Marsten House, an ominous old property on a hilltop which has a reputation for being haunted. Mears attempts to rent the house but finds that another new arrival in town, the mysterious Richard Straker (James Mason), has recently bought it. Straker also opens an antique shop with his oft-mentioned but always absent business partner, Kurt Barlow. Meanwhile, Mears moves into a boarding house in town run by Eva Miller (Marie Windsor), and develops a romantic relationship with a local woman, Susan Norton (Bonnie Bedelia). He befriends Susan's father, Dr. Bill Norton (Ed Flanders), and also renews his old friendship with his former school teacher, Jason Burke (Lew Ayres). Mears tells Burke that he feels the Marsten House is somehow inherently evil, and recalls how he was once traumatized inside the house when he was a child. After a large crate is delivered to the Marsten House one night, an increasing number of the townsfolk begin to disappear or die in strange circumstances. Both Mears and Straker are initially the main suspects as they are new in town, but it becomes clear that the crate contained Straker's mysterious business partner, Kurt Barlow (Reggie Nalder), an ancient master vampire who has come to the town after having sent Straker to make way for his arrival. Straker kidnaps a young local boy, Ralphie Glick (Ronnie Scribner), as an offering to Barlow, while Barlow himself kills local realtor Larry Crockett (Fred Willard). The Glick boy then returns as a vampire to claim his brother,...\nA:", "response": "\"Shadow Over Salem: The Marsten Haunting\"", "token_count": 491}
{"id": "example_11113", "prompt": "Sentence 1: Type-3 worksharing is where the mailer's decision, whether or not he turns the mail over to a competitor, is influenced by factors other than the size of the discount and his cost of doing the work.\n\nSentence 2: Type-3 worksharing is when the mailer decides something is influenced by something other than the size of discount or his cost of work.\n\nIf the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?", "response": "Both sentences describe Type-3 worksharing, but they provide slightly different perspectives on the concept. The first sentence focuses more on the decision-making process of the mailer and the factors that influence it, whereas the second sentence simplifies the concept into a more general definition. In order to assess the truth of the second sentence based on the first sentence, let's analyze both sentences in detail.\n\nSentence 1: Type-3 worksharing is where the mailer's decision, whether or not he turns the mail over to a competitor, is influenced by factors other than the size of the discount and his cost of doing the work.\n\nThis sentence explains that Type-3 worksharing involves a mailer's decision-making process, in which the mailer must decide whether or not to hand over mail to a competitor. The factors that influence this decision do not revolve solely around the size of the discount or the mailer's cost of doing the work, suggesting that there are other variables at play.\n\nSentence 2: Type-3 worksharing is when the mailer decides something is influenced by something other than the size of discount or his cost of work.\n\nThis sentence offers a more simplified explanation of Type-3 worksharing. It states that the mailer's decision is influenced by factors other than the size of the discount and the cost of work, which aligns with the idea presented in the first sentence. However, it doesn't specifically mention the context of turning mail over to a competitor. Instead, it offers a more generalized idea of what factors influence the mailer's decision.\n\nComparing both sentences, we can conclude that the second sentence is indeed true, as it captures the essence of Type-3 worksharing—that a mailer's decision is affected by factors other than the size of the discount and the cost of work. However, it is important to note that while the second sentence is true, it is less detailed and specific compared to the first sentence that provides context in terms of turning the mail over to a competitor. So, it can be said that the second sentence is true, but it offers a less comprehensive understanding of Type-3 worksharing.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_8561", "prompt": "Answer the following question: Information:  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \"Londinium\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \"London\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Mount Vesuvius ( also \"Vesevus\" or \"Vesaevus\" in some Roman sources) is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about east of Naples and a short distance from the shore. It is one of several volcanoes which form the Campanian volcanic arc. Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure.  - A multi-sport event is an organized sports event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation states. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance is the modern Olympic Games.  - Rome is a city and special \"comune\" (named \"Roma Capitale\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \"comune\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - International mostly means something (a company, language, or organization) involving more than a single country. The term international as a word means involvement of, interaction between or encompassing more than one nation, or generally beyond national boundaries. For example, international law, which is applied by more than one country and usually everywhere on Earth, and international language which is a language spoken by residents of more than one country.  - The 1908 Summer Olympics, officially the Games of the IV Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event which was held in 1908 in London, England from 27 April to 31 October 1908. These games were originally scheduled to be held in Rome, but were re-located on financial grounds following a disastrous eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906. They were the fourth chronological modern Olympic Games in keeping with the now-accepted four-year cycle as opposed to the proposed Intercalated Games alternate four-year cycle. The IOC president for these Games was Baron Pierre de Coubertin. Lasting a total of 187 days, or 6 months and 4 days, these games were the longest in modern Olympics history.  - The Free State of Saxony is a landlocked federal state of Germany, bordering the federal states of Brandenburg, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia, and Bavaria, as well as the countries of Poland (Lower Silesian and Lubusz Voivodeships) and the Czech Republic (Karlovy Vary, Liberec and Ústí nad Labem Regions). Its capital is Dresden, and its largest city is Leipzig.  - The Intercalated Olympic Games were to be a series of \"International Olympic Games\" halfway between what is now known as the Games of the Olympiad. This proposed series of games, intercalated in the Olympic Games cycle, was to always be held in Athens, and were to have equal status with the international games. However, the only such games were held in 1906.  - Karl Neumer ( 23 February 1887 in Reinhardtsgrimma -- 16 May 1984 ) was a German track cycling racer who competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics . He won two medals - bronze in the individual sprint and silver , together with his teammates Max Götze , Rudolf Katzer , and Hermann Martens , in the team pursuit . He also competed in the 5000 metres race , but was eliminated in the first round .  - Glashütte is a town in Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge, Free State of Saxony, Germany, which was the birthplace of the German watchmaking industry. The city has a population of about 7,000. Historically it was first mentioned in a document around 1445. In January 2008, the former municipality Reinhardtsgrimma was merged into Glashütte.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - Reinhardtsgrimma is a former municipality in the district of Weißeritzkreis in Saxony in Germany located near Dresden. On 2 January 2008, it merged into the town Glashütte.  - The Weißeritzkreis is a former district (\"Kreis\") in the south of the Free State of Saxony, Germany.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal?\nTo paint a doll with something that resembles blood, you can\n\nPick your answer from: --Use red paint on the doll to create something resembling blood --Use blue paint on the doll to create something resembling blood", "response": "To paint a doll with something that resembles blood, it is recommended to use red paint on the doll as this will create a much more convincing and realistic depiction of blood. Using blue paint would not be an accurate representation of blood and may not look as believable. Below are detailed steps to achieve a blood-like effect using red paint on a doll.\n\n1. Gather materials: To begin, you'll need to gather the required materials. You'll need a doll, red paint (preferably acrylic), a paintbrush, a disposable plate or palette to mix the paint, water, a tissue or paper towel, and a work surface covered with a drop cloth or newspaper.\n\n2. Choose the right shade: To make a realistic blood color, choose a deep red shade of paint. An optional step to make it appear more realistic is to mix in a small amount of black or brown paint to create a slightly darker and richer hue.\n\n3. Test the paint: Before applying the paint to the doll, test it on a small piece of paper or fabric to ensure that you're satisfied with the color and consistency of the paint. The paint should be thick and dark, resembling real blood. If necessary, adjust the mixture accordingly.\n\n4. Prepare the doll: Ensure the doll is clean and free of any dirt or dust. This will help the paint adhere better to the surface. If the doll has any clothing or accessories, it's best to remove them to avoid getting paint on these items.\n\n5. Apply the paint: To create a realistic blood effect, use a paintbrush to apply the mixture to the areas of the doll where you want the blood to appear. Begin by dabbing the paintbrush on the surface to create an irregular, dripping, or splattered effect. Blood is not always evenly distributed, so adding some splatters, smudges, and drips can enhance the overall visual impact.\n\n6. Use varying techniques: To achieve different blood effects, like dried blood, use a slightly darker shade of red, and apply it using a more controlled, dabbing motion. For fresh, wet blood, use a brighter red shade and create generous amounts of paint in select areas. This will give the appearance of freshly spilled blood.\n\n7. Blend the paint: If needed, use water and a clean brush to gently blend the paint on the doll. This will help create softer edges and ensure the paint appears natural on the surface. Be careful not to over-blend, as this may cause the paint to lose its intended effect.\n\n8. Add final touches: Using a small detail brush or a toothpick, you can further enhance the blood effect by carefully drawing thin blood trails or additional splatter patterns.\n\n9. Let the paint dry: Allow the paint to fully dry before touching or moving the doll. Acrylic paint usually takes between 20 to 30 minutes to fully dry, but it might take longer depending on the thickness of the paint layers.\n\n10. Seal the paint: If you want to protect and preserve the paint job, you can finish the process by applying a clear, matte or satin varnish on the painted areas. This will prevent the paint from chipping or rubbing off over time.\n\nBy using red paint to create a blood-like effect on the doll, you can achieve a striking and realistic appearance that resembles actual blood.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_5120", "prompt": "Question: What happens if you trip while playing basketball?  Choices:  - sweat - dribbling - hurt yourself - fall down - make baskets  The rationale to choose \"fall down\" as the answer is that:", "response": "When playing basketball, tripping can lead to various outcomes, depending on the severity and context. However, among the given choices, \"fall down\" is the most appropriate answer as it is the most direct consequence of tripping while playing basketball. Here is the rationale for choosing \"fall down\":\n\n1. Sweat: Sweating is a natural bodily function that occurs in any physical activity, not just in basketball or as a result of tripping. It is the body's way to cool itself down during exercise. Sweating is not directly related to tripping as it can happen even while playing without falling.\n\n2. Dribbling: Dribbling is an essential basketball skill where the player bounces the ball continuously on the court. It is a technique used to move with the ball, making it difficult for the opposition to steal it. While tripping might be caused by a failed attempt at dribbling or intercepting the ball, it is not a consequence of tripping.\n\n3. Hurt yourself: While it's true that you can potentially hurt yourself when tripping during basketball, injuries can result from various actions and incidents. Not every trip necessarily leads to hurting yourself, as sometimes players may fall in a way that avoids injury.\n\n4. Fall down: Tripping in basketball is most likely to result in falling down on the court. Losing balance or stumbling due to contact with another player or misstep can cause a player to fall. Falling down is the most direct consequence of tripping, making it the best answer among the choices given.\n\n5. Make baskets: Making baskets is scoring points by shooting the ball into the opponents' hoop. Tripping, on the other hand, is an undesirable event that hinders a player's performance on the court and is not related to making baskets.\n\nIn summary, among the options provided, \"fall down\" is the most suitable answer as it is the most immediate result of tripping while playing basketball. Furthermore, falling down could lead to potential injuries, but not every fall results in hurt. Other outcomes, such as sweating, dribbling, and making baskets, are not directly related to tripping incidents during the game.", "token_count": 496}

Police said nothing suspicious was found after officers searched all of the schools in the province.\n\n“The minister of public safety just informed me that all of the schools’ children and personnel are safe. The situation is under control,” the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said at a news conference in Ottawa.\n\nSgt Kevin Baillie of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the Prince Edward Island threat came via fax on Wednesday morning, and that schools on the normally sleepy island were notified within 10 minutes.\n\n“There’s been no threat found. Everybody is safe,” he told reporters.\n\nThe threat was faxed to police in Canada’s capital of Ottawa, Baillie said.\n\n“The message stated that the bombs had been placed at a number of schools and would be detonated today,” he said.\n\nA senior police official said a “swatting”-style computer distributed a threat to jurisdictions across Canada and in the US and authorities were trying to locate the source.\n\nSwatting is when someone contacts emergency services to deceive officials and report a bogus threat so that emergency personnel go to a scene. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about the investigation.\n\nPolice in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in the central part of Canada are also investigating a threat against the city’s largest school division that appears similar to the one on Prince Edward Island.\n\nPolice say the Winnipeg school division received a faxed message about 8.30am that contained a threat to all schools within its jurisdiction. Schools were not evacuated or placed in lockdown.\n\nStudents at more than 60 English language and French language schools in Prince Edward Island were taken to safe locations by staff outside the schools, where buses met them.\n\nBaillie said bomb threats were hard to evaluate for credibility, but said authorities like to err on the side of caution. “This disrupts a lot of lives,” he said.\n\nParents and guardians were asked to wait for further instructions before picking up their children.\n\nTrudeau said he empathized with parents.\n\n“As a parent, I know how worrisome this type of situation can be. I know the affected parents must be having a difficult day,” Trudeau said.\n\nParker Grimmer, the island’s director of public schools, said police had contacted the school system on Wednesday morning about “a threat that was of a significant nature” and asked for the evacuation of all schools. He said he expected all students to return to classes on Thursday.\n\n“This is new to us, so we are reacting in a new way,” Grimmer said. “But we have plans and procedures and I think we followed them.”\n\nAt Holland College in the provincial capital of Charlottetown, a woman burst into the classroom to tell everyone to pick up their books and evacuate immediately, student Morgan McNeil said. Outside, everyone was in a panic and helicopters were flying overhead, he said.\n\nBaillie said similar threats had been made to schools and colleges in the nearby province of Nova Scotia, where the Nova Scotia Community College Marconi campus, Cape Breton University and the NSCC technology campus in Halifax were evacuated.\n\nAt least one school in the US was also threatened, he said. It was not immediately clear which one was involved or if it was evacuated.\nWhat are the most important parts of this news article?", "response": "1. More than 19,000 students were evacuated from schools in Prince Edward Island, Canada, following a bomb threat received via fax by police.

A similar threat was also received by Winnipeg's largest school division, but no evacuations or lockdowns were initiated.\n\n4. Police suspect that this could be a case of \"swatting\", where a person falsely alerts the authorities about a non-existent threat. Investigations are ongoing to locate the source of these threats.\n\n5. Students were moved to safe locations and parents were asked to wait for instructions before picking up their children. Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, empathized with parents in these anxious situations.\n\n6.

The Chelsea manager insists he was joking and fumed at the ethics of the journalists who recorded his comments.\n\ndarkened his mood on the eve of a reunion with", "response": "Galatasaray legend Didier Drogba in a crucial Champions League clash on Wednesday night. The Portuguese tactician did not take kindly to his private comments being made public, especially since it could potentially disrupt the harmony within the already tense locker room. \n\nAddressing the media in a pre-match press conference, Mourinho expressed his disappointment and frustration over the breach of trust and lashed out at those responsible for the leak. He reiterated that his relationship with Samuel Eto'o is strong and there is no animosity between them. Mourinho cited the context in which the conversation took place, which included him poking fun at his players and himself, further clarifying that his words were merely jests and should not be taken seriously.\n\nAdditionally, Mourinho highlighted the importance of focusing on the upcoming encounter with Galatasaray and the return of former Chelsea idol Didier Drogba. The Ivorian striker, who spent eight eventful seasons at Stamford Bridge before joining the Turkish giants, will be making his first appearance at his old stomping ground since departing the London-based club. As a game-changer in many vital matches for Chelsea, Drogba's highly-anticipated visit evoked excitement and nostalgia among the Blues' faithful.\n\nGiven the crucial nature of the Champions League fixture, Mourinho called for unity and support from the entire Chelsea setup, emphasizing that every player, including Eto'o and the rest of the strikers, possess a pivotal role in their hunt for European glory. He urged his team to remain professional and stay focused on the task at hand, brushing aside any distractions or negative press that threaten their campaign.\n\nHowever, some pundits believe that Mourinho's reaction to the incident could serve as a motivational factor, galvanizing the players and fostering a stronger team spirit. With their backs against the wall following the leak, the Chelsea squad may find an additional layer of determination to work together and prove their mettle on the grand stage that is the UEFA Champions League.\n\nAs the encounter against Galatasaray approaches, all eyes will be on Chelsea and Mourinho to see how they cope with the recent controversy and whether it will indeed impact their performance. On the flip side, a resounding display of unity and a hard-fought victory would be the ultimate response to the recent turmoil and, perhaps, the best way to silence their critics.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_4302", "prompt": "Write the answer: What word is used by Christians for the suffering and death of Jesus?", "response": "The word used by Christians for the suffering and death of Jesus Christ is \"Passion.\" The term traces its etymology back to the Latin word \"passio,\" which means \"suffering\" or \"enduring.\" In the context of the life of Jesus, the Passion specifically refers to the events and episodes leading up to and including His crucifixion.\n\nTo provide a comprehensive understanding of the Passion, it is essential to outline the key events narrated in the four Gospels–Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John–which chronicle Jesus' final moments. Although the Gospels differ in some details and emphasis, they collectively present a poignant portrayal of the Passion of Jesus Christ.\n\n1. The Last Supper: Before the suffering and crucifixion, Jesus shared a final meal with His disciples, now known as the Last Supper. This gathering is significant in Christianity as it is when Jesus instituted the sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, symbolized by the breaking of bread and sharing of wine, which represent His body and blood.\n\n2. The Agony in the Garden: After the Last Supper, Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray. He was in deep distress, aware of the impending betrayal and the suffering to come. During this time, Jesus prayed to God, asking for strength to endure the painful ordeal.\n\n3. The Betrayal by Judas and Arrest: One of Jesus' disciples, Judas Iscariot, had agreed to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. Led by temple guards and Roman soldiers, Judas identified Jesus with a traitorous kiss, leading to His arrest.\n\n4. The Trials: Jesus was subjected to a series of trials that started with a preliminary hearing before the Sanhedrin (the Jewish supreme council) and the high priest. He was then presented to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea. Pilate initially found no guilt in Jesus and sent Him to Herod Antipas, ruler of Galilee. Unsuccessful in eliciting a confession, Antipas subsequently returned Jesus to Pilate, who eventually yielded to the crowd's demand to crucify Jesus in place of the criminal Barabbas.\n\n5. The Scourging and Crowning with Thorns: Before crucifixion, Jesus was brutally beaten and scourged by Roman soldiers in an act of severe physical torture. In a cruel mockery of His claim to be the \"King of the Jews,\" the soldiers adorned Jesus with a purple robe and a crown made of thorns, causing unbearable pain and humiliation.\n\n6. The Crucifixion and Death: Carrying the heavy wooden cross, Jesus was led to Golgotha (also known as the Place of the Skull) to be nailed to the cross alongside two criminals. Jesus endured unimaginable pain and suffering on the cross for several hours before He ultimately surrendered His spirit to God and passed away.\n\n7. The Burial: After His death, Jesus' body was taken down from the cross, wrapped in a burial shroud, and placed in a tomb donated by a wealthy follower, Joseph of Arimathea.\n\nThe Passion is central to Christian belief because it exemplifies Jesus' ultimate act of self-sacrifice for the spiritual redemption of humanity. This event, along with Jesus' subsequent resurrection, forms the basis of Christian faith and salvation. The Passion is observed and commemorated by Christians around the world, particularly during Holy Week–the final week of Lent–culminating in the solemn observance of Good Friday, the day on which Jesus was crucified.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_12381", "prompt": "Dropbox Says Controlling its Own Tech Make it Faster, Nimbler\n\nDropbox, the cloud storage company that says it has half a billion users, now says it’s well on its way to 200,000 paying business customers. And Dropbox CEO Drew Houston is banking that its new home-built infrastructure will help it save money and be more flexible when building new features.\n\nIn March, Dropbox disclosed that, over the past few years, it had moved about 90% of its IT infrastructure off of Amazon amzn Web Services and into its own data centers. That migration seemed counterintuitive in an era when many companies are shutting down data centers or foregoing new ones in favor of putting their work into Amazon’s public cloud.\n\n“We’re planning for the long term, this was a foundational thing,” Houston said at Fortune’s Brainstorm Tech conference on Monday in Aspen, Co.\n\nHe also stressed that, given the amount of data Dropbox handles it is somewhat unique in its IT needs. It also continues to use AWS for some tasks and for global reach.\n\n“It’s a big bet we placed,” Houston added speaking of the migration. “We went from zero to standing up one of the largest cloud infrastructures in the world.”\n\nThat required moving several hundred petabytes of data from AWS to internal servers without users noticing.\n\nHouston and Dropbox chief operating officer Dennis Woodside said upcoming Dropbox features are tied to its data center migration. They include “Project Infinite,” which will let users view all their files from a device without actually downloading them.\n\nCloud computing had a wild and wooly week.\n\nDropbox will enable that via smart caching, Dropbox’s newfound ability to modify the data center hardware it uses is very different from what is allowed in the public cloud scenario, Woodside told Fortune before the talk on stage.\n\nDropbox, of course, has lots of users who do not pay. Neither Houston nor Woodside would comment on what percentage of that 500 million number are active users. Paying customers, on the other hand, pay for either Dropbox Pro or Dropbox Business for cloud storage and file synchronization. Dropbox competes with Box, as well as products from software giantsMicrosoft, Google in this tightly contested market.\n\nThe 200,000 number surfaced during a panel discussion on Monday.\n\nDropbox Strengthens Mobile Support, Gets Closer to IBM\n\n“We are on track to pass the 200,000 teams mark for Dropbox Business, which was launched less than five years ago,” Woodside said before the event. “It took eight or nine years for Salesforce crm to get to 100,000 teams.”\n\nDropbox, like many software companies of its era, got its start offering free or near-free software but is now is eager to show it can woo paying customers as well as it pushes towards profitability.\n\nThe company claims big accounts including Hewlett-Packard Enterprise hpe , News Corp., and Expedia expe , which it says has 4,000 users on Dropbox. Woodside seems particularly proud of that account given that Expedia is a spin out of Microsoft msft . And more recently, the Washington Post has a few thousand users on Dropbox, he said.\n\n“What we see is significant growth especially in enterprise class companies. Our enterprise business selling into companies with over 1,000 employees has grown triple digits in past year,” Woodside said in an interview before the event. No specific numbers were forthcoming.\n\nWoodside also said that 52% of the Fortune 500 has paid Dropbox for a deployment of some kind, although would not comment on whether any of those deals were company wide.\n\nDropbox claims its advantage is that it “plays well with all ecosystems.” That means Dropbox works well for users in the Apple aapl or Microsoft msft or Google goog worlds to create and refine their documents.\n\nThe company, which has raised over $600 million in funding, is threading the needle here. It says its cloud storage and file-sharing software works better across various software platforms (Microsoft and Google, for example) than either of those two companies do because they want customers to stay on their own software all the time.\n\nNone of those tech giants, the pitch goes, is particularly anxious to make its own software work well with products from its mega-rivals, which means it probably makes more sense to use Microsoft OneDrive for Microsoft msft Office files and Google Drive for Google goog Apps.\n\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily newsletter on the business of technology.\n\nThat’s basically the same argument Box box , the other major independent player in this market, makes. Box, unlike Dropbox, started out with a corporate focus. But as Dropbox ramps up its business push, the two are competing more directly.\n\nBut Dropbox also argues that all those consumer users are its best sales people. “They bring us to work,” Woodside said. The implication here is that Dropbox is easier to use than Box, a contention that Box chief executive Aaron Levie would no doubt dispute.\n\nWrite a one or two sentence summary.", "response": "Dropbox claims that it is faster and more flexible since it decided to replace 90% of its IT infrastructure run by Amazon Web Services with its own data centres.

I seldom take the time to write reviews, but my experience at this astounding establishment calls for it.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, I was immediately struck by the romantic and serene atmosphere created by the soft lighting and an alluring array of lush, green plants that adorned the walls and pathways. It felt as if I had stepped into an emerald oasis, making it the perfect escape from the city's hustle and bustle.\n\nThe hostess promptly guided us to our table, which was nestled amidst a cozy arrangement of ornate chairs and elegantly set tables. Our server, Bianca, greeted us with the warmest smile and unparalleled professionalism. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and passionately enriched us with details about the dishes, which truly enhanced our dining experience.\n\nWe began our taste journey with the Chef's Special Appetizer Platter, which was a dazzling melange of flavors and textures. The bruschetta was topped with vibrant heirloom tomatoes, fresh basil, and a perfect balance of garlic and balsamic dressing. I also savored the pan-seared scallops, surrounded by a velvety citrus-infused sauce that complemented the sweetness of the dish.\n\nFor our main course, my partner and I decided to share the Seafood Paella and Truffle Mushroom Risotto. The paella was abundant with fragrant saffron-infused rice, succulent shrimp, tender mussels, and delicate clams; it was truly an explosion of flavors that delighted our palates. The Truffle Mushroom Risotto was equally impressive, blending luscious, earthy truffles with creamy Parmesan, and the al dente Arborio rice was cooked to absolute perfection.\n\nAt Bianca's insistence, we decided to save room for dessert—a decision I will forever cherish. We indulged in a heavenly slice of Chocolate Decadence Cake which was, without a doubt, the most divine creation I have ever tasted. The rich, velvety chocolate ganache perfectly complemented the moist layers of cake, while a scoop of homemade raspberry sorbet added a refreshing and tart contrast, making for an unforgettable finale to our meal.\n\nThe service throughout the evening remained attentive and seamless, with Bianca ensuring all of our needs were met while never being intrusive. It's safe to say that the staff at The Enchanted Garden exudes genuine warmth and an unwavering commitment to providing an unparalleled dining experience.\n\nThe Enchanted Garden is a true gem that embodies the essence of fine dining. Their exceptional attention to detail, unparalleled service, and delectable cuisine make it a must-visit, whether for a romantic date or a special celebration.

{"id": "example_2560", "prompt": "I read this background article the other day: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection .

I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been.

Context: Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates, and 1909, the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective.

{"id": "example_10268", "prompt": "Here is a question about this article: The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), for supremacy in spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II, enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel. The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite \"in the near future\". The Soviet Union beat the US to this, with the October 4, 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1, and later beat the US to the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961. The Space Race peaked with the July 20, 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11. The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions, and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations. A period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew.\nWhat is the answer to this question: Sputnik 1 started orbiting on what date?", "response": "Sputnik 1 started orbiting on October 4, 1957. This was when the Soviet Union launched the first-ever artificial satellite into space, and it was a big moment in the Space Race.", "token_count": 422}

{"id": "example_9546", "prompt": "Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that studied at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig? from the following article ?  Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\", before, it seems, \"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\".\nA:", "response": "The full name of the person that studied at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig is Reinhard Keiser.", "token_count": 503}

Three men and three women will spend eight months living in a special place on the side of a volcano in Hawaii. They are part of an experiment that is designed to mimic life on Mars. Their mission began on October 15, 2014. NASA says it could send astronauts to Mars as early as the 2030s. The mission would take more than two years, so NASA needs to know how people would react to living in a small group, isolated from the rest of the world, for such a long time.

It includes shared areas like kitchen, dining room, bathroom, laboratory and an exercise room. The upstairs is less than half the size of the downstairs. It contains another bathroom and six small bedrooms. The building is located in an abandoned quarry about 2,400 meters up the side of Mauna Loa, the second biggest volcano in the world. It is constantly monitored for signs of volcanic activity. NASA chose the location because the appearance looks very similar to Mars.

{"id": "example_11131", "prompt": "Generate a context and a hypothesis.", "response": "Context: The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in urban transportation systems.\n\nOver the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the global interest and demand for electric vehicles. The change has been partly driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase energy efficiency, lower oil dependence, and foster innovation in urban transportation. As a result, numerous governments, corporations, and public interest groups have mobilized substantial resources to facilitate the shift toward more sustainable forms of transportation, such as electric vehicles. Factors like technological advancements in battery systems, government incentives, and public awareness campaigns have promoted EV adoption rates worldwide. Consequently, the growing presence of EVs in urban areas has led to changes in the way people perceive, plan, and use transportation. \n\nHypothesis: Increased electric vehicle adoption will lead to a significant improvement in air quality, reduction in noise pollution, and positive changes in urban lifestyle.\n\nThe hypothesis states that as the popularity of electric vehicles continues to surge, the shift will deliver notable environmental and socio-economic benefits. Specifically, the hypothesis entails the following outcomes:\n\n1. Improvement in air quality: Electric vehicles emit zero tailpipe emissions, thus contributing to a decrease in harmful particulate matter and chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds linked to internal combustion engine vehicles. By lowering these harmful emissions, air quality in urban areas would vastly improve.\n\n2. Reduction in noise pollution: EVs operate more quietly compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Wide-scale adoption of electric vehicles will substantially reduce noise levels in urban environments, improving the overall quality of life for residents.\n\n3. Positive changes in urban lifestyle: The adoption of electric vehicles would encourage the development of EV-related infrastructure, such as charging stations and battery swapping stations. This transition would not only create new economic opportunities but also stimulate the growth of urban spaces that prioritize pedestrians and bicycling, promoting healthier and more environmentally friendly lifestyles. Additionally, the increasing number of EVs would lead to reduced traffic congestion, as autonomous driving features become more prevalent.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, data on air quality levels, metrics for noise pollution, and indicators of urban lifestyle quality would need to be collected and analyzed in cities where electric vehicle adoption is high or rapidly increasing. Comparisons with cities where EV usage is low or unchanged would help draw conclusions regarding the role of electric vehicles in fostering these improvements.", "token_count": 493}

To keep the virus a secret, U.S. Army officers Donald McClintock and William Ford destroy the army camp where soldiers were infected. In 1995, the virus resurfaces in Zaire. Colonel Sam Daniels, a USAMRIID virologist, is sent to investigate. He and his crewâLieutenant Colonel Casey Schuler and new recruit Major Saltâgather information and return to the United States. Daniels asks his superior, (now) Brigadier General William Ford, to issue an alert but Ford tells Daniels the virus is unlikely to spread. Betsy, a white-headed capuchin monkey (a host species for the virus), is smuggled into the United States. When James \"Jimbo\" Scottâan employee of the Biotest animal-holding facilityâsteals Betsy and brings her to Cedar Creek, California, to sell on the black market, he is infected. Jimbo fails to sell Betsy to Rudy Alvarez, a pet-store owner who wanted a male for a customer. Rudy is also infected, and \"Jimbo\" releases the female monkey in the woods. He develops symptoms on a flight to Boston and infects his girlfriend, Alice. They are hospitalized, and Dr. Roberta Keoughâa CDC scientist and Daniels' ex-wifeâinvestigates their illness. Jimbo, Alice, and Rudy die, but Keough determines that no one else in Boston was infected. Technicians at a Cedar Creek hospital, including Henry, run tests on Rudy's blood; Henry is infected when he accidentally breaks a vial of Rudy's blood. It is later found that the virus mutated into a strain capable of spreading like influenza, and a number of people are exposed in a movie theater. Daniels learns about the infection and flies to Cedar Creek against Ford's orders, joining Keough's team with Schuler and Salt. As they begin a search for the host animal, the U.S. Army quarantines the town and imposes martial law. Schuler is infected when his suit tears, and Keough accidentally sticks herself with a contaminated needle. Ford provides an experimental serum to treat the sick...

They realize this is because the monkey has developed antibodies against the virus, making her immune.\n\nSalt extracts blood from Betsy and isolates the antibodies from her blood serum. By doing so, he formulates an antiserum to treat the infected people in Cedar Creek. This antiserum is then mass-produced and administered to the affected population, ultimately saving the town from the outbreak and preventing a nationwide epidemic of the deadly virus.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_8484", "prompt": "Even though he sailed to the White House on the wings of his soaring rhetoric, President Barack Obama could find that he is on mission impossible as he launches his media blitz on Syria this week -- six television interviews on Monday and a dramatic prime time address on Tuesday. Perhaps he will persuade a skeptical public, but it is surely the toughest speaking assignment of his presidency. Surprisingly, he is now tripling down on his Syrian bet. First he drew the red line, uncertain whether President Bashar al-Assad would call his bluff. Then he doubled down by insisting on a vote from an unreliable Congress. Now he is placing almost all his chips on the table by betting on his capacity to turn around public opinion. If he wins over the public, he will likely win Congress, too, but if he fails, he will have turned a problem in Syria into a crisis in his presidency. (Someday, in their memoirs, will White House insiders please tell us what they were thinking?) There are at least two major hurdles in his path as he seeks to persuade the public. First, he will be trying to change opinion that has already started to harden against him. Second, the bully pulpit may not be as powerful as often imagined. The intensity factor. It's hard to remember a public terrain as rough as this one for a president in the past few decades. Weary of war and wary of another, Americans are in no mood to rally behind this call to arms -- many don't see it as our fight, they worry that it will drag us in deeper and even some of his most ardent supporters think the president and his team don't have a firm grip on the wheel. A Gallup poll late this past week found that a majority of the public (51% to 36%) is opposed to a Syrian strike. That is the lowest level of support Gallup has found for any intervention in two decades. Moreover, the \"intensity factor\" runs much more strongly among opponents -- just look at the avalanche of their calls and e-mails to Capitol Hill. The president has been arguing his case for nearly three weeks, and so far, he doesn't have many converts on the Hill. That's among Democrats as well as Republicans. CNN's whip count suggests that he could win a tight vote in the Senate (his speech may work best there), but a strike resolution is in serious trouble in the House. The Washington Post count shows that as many as a third of House Democrats may vote no. Even overseas, among nations much closer to Syria, the president's rhetorical offensive has fallen short. No president in modern times has had such a tiny coalition behind him. Eighteen nations contributed to the intervention in Libya. President George W. Bush had 48 nations in the coalition that attacked Saddam Hussein. This time around, Obama will have only a handful supporting his intervention and most will be cheering from the sidelines. A shaky pulpit. This controversy is also coming at an inopportune moment for the president. Early on at the White House, he could command massive, almost adoring audiences at every major address. But with the exception of his speech announcing the killing of Osama bin Laden, the numbers tuning in have dropped, viewers tend to be more partisan and television commentators have toughened up on him. Notably, his two Syrian interviews on television so far have drawn only modest audiences. It has been little noticed but is important now that Obama has also had more success selling himself than his policies. Obama's speeches -- despite their rhetorical strength and skilled delivery -- have had little success in moving his agenda forward. Americans still like him, but they tend to make up their own minds about his policies. Witness his inability, even now, to build a public majority in favor of Obamacare. The White House would argue that a majority have supported his stands on gun control and gay rights, but is that because of his speeches or because of demographic shifts and events such as the Newtown elementary school massacre? Indeed, there is now a debate among political scientists whether the bully pulpit is all that it is cracked up to be, especially in contemporary politics. Professor George Edwards of Texas A&M University and a dean among political scientists concluded in his 2006 book, \"On Deaf Ears: The Limits of the Bully Pulpit,\" that we have a highly inflated view of how much presidents have been able to change public minds through their speeches. He presents numerous cases to support his argument and one that is especially relevant today:. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had a legendary ability to connect with Americans through his fireside chats, but when it came to convincing a skeptical public about his Supreme Court-packing bill in his second term, the fire fizzled out. Edwards' data also suggests that presidents only succeed in mobilizing the public when opinion is already in their favor. This is clearly not the case with Syria. To our memory, the last Oval Office address that dramatically moved the public opinion needle over military conflict came in late 1983 when President Ronald Reagan spoke to the country about a bloody attack on marine barracks in Lebanon and U.S. intervention in the tiny island of Grenada. Public support for military action jumped 10 points in immediate polling. But in that case, Reagan was telling a story about what had already happened to a public whose majority already favored intervention. He was not asking them to rally round a new, uncertain venture, and he was also still in his first term when audiences were big. This is not to argue that all is lost for Obama on Tuesday night. Big speeches can reframe issues. They can unite us behind a higher purpose. They can push us to question our firmly held beliefs. Obama does have unusually persuasive powers. Perhaps he can come up with fresh arguments that will bring undecideds in his direction. Perhaps he will have horrific new evidence of how brutal al-Assad is. Perhaps ... perhaps, but if he has new arrows in his quiver, he likely would have shot them by now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergan and Dan Katz.\n\nWrite highlights for this article.", "response": "President Barack Obama faced a significant challenge as he launched his media blitz on Syria in an attempt to persuade a skeptical public in 2013.

{"id": "example_5929", "prompt": "Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \"Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous. These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\",  answer the following question.

Since her account earns a simple interest of 10% per annum, the interest calculation will be as follows:\n\nSimple interest = Principal × Rate × Time\nWhere Principal is the initial amount, Rate is the interest rate, and Time is the number of years.\n\nIn this case:\nPrincipal = $600\nRate = 10% (0.10 in decimal form)\nTime = 2 years\n\nCalculating the interest:\nSimple interest = $600 × 0.10 × 2\nSimple interest = $120\n\nNow, we know that Ariella will earn $120 in interest after two years. To find the total amount in her son's savings account after two years, we will add the interest to the initial amount:\n\nTotal amount = Initial amount + Interest\nTotal amount = $600 + $120\nTotal amount = $720\n\nSo, Ariella will have $720 in her son's savings account after two years.", "token_count": 434}

The gas reaches the town and turns most of its residents into deformed bloodthirsty psychopaths, referred to as \"sickos\" by the surviving humans. The infected townspeople are treated by the sinister Dr. William Block (Josh Brolin) and his unhappy, unfaithful bisexual anesthesiologist wife Dakota (Marley Shelton) at a local hospital. Random zombie attacks begin along the highway, causing El Wray, with Cherry as his passenger, to crash his truck. In the aftermath, several zombies tear off Cherry's right leg. Also falling victim, fatally, is Tammy (Stacy \"Fergie\" Ferguson), who was on her way to into town to reunite with her former lover Dakota. When Tammy's body arrives at the hospital, Dr. Block recognizes her and by comparing text messages on the cellular phones of Tammy and his wife, realizes Dakota was about to leave him.

{"id": "example_1159", "prompt": "Background: William II (Old Norman: Williame; c. 1056 - 2 August 1100), the third son of William the Conqueror, was King of England from 1087 until 1100, with powers over Normandy, and influence in Scotland. He was less successful in extending control into Wales. William is commonly known as William Rufus (Rufus being Latin for 'the Red'), perhaps because of his red-faced appearance or, more likely, due to having red hair as a child that grew out in later life.\nContext: William Rufus inherited the Anglo-Norman settlement detailed in the Domesday Book, a survey undertaken at his father's command, essentially for the purposes of taxation, which was an example of the control of the English monarchy. If he was less effective than his father in containing the Norman lords' propensity for rebellion and violence, through charisma, or political skills, he was forceful in overcoming the consequences. In 1095, Robert de Mowbray, the earl of Northumbria, refused to attend the Curia Regis, the thrice-annual court where the King announced his governmental decisions to the great lords. William led an army against Robert and defeated him. Robert was dispossessed and imprisoned, and another noble, William of Eu, accused of treachery, was blinded and castrated.  In external affairs, William had some successes. In 1091 he repulsed an invasion by King Malcolm III of Scotland, forcing Malcolm to pay homage. In 1092 he built Carlisle Castle, taking control of Cumberland and Westmorland, which had previously been claimed by the Scots. Subsequently, the two kings quarrelled over Malcolm's possessions in England, and Malcolm again invaded, ravaging Northumbria. At the Battle of Alnwick, on 13 November 1093, Malcolm was ambushed by Norman forces led by Robert de Mowbray. Malcolm and his son Edward were killed and Malcolm III's brother Donald seized the throne. William supported Malcolm's son Duncan II, who held power for a short time, and then another of Malcolm's sons, Edgar. Edgar conquered Lothian in 1094 and eventually removed Donald in 1097 with William's aid in a campaign led by Edgar AEtheling. Edgar recognised William's authority over Lothian and attended William's court.  William made two forays into Wales in 1097. Nothing decisive was achieved, but a series of castles was constructed as a marchland defensive barrier.  In 1096, William's brother Robert Curthose joined the First Crusade. He needed money to fund this venture and pledged his Duchy of Normandy to William in return for a payment of 10,000 marks--a sum equalling about a quarter of William's annual revenue. In a display of the effectiveness of English taxation, William raised the money by levying a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England. William then ruled Normandy as regent in Robert's absence. Robert did not return until September 1100, one month after William's death.  As regent for his brother Robert in Normandy, William campaigned in France from 1097 to 1099. He secured northern Maine but failed to seize the French-controlled part of the Vexin region. According to William of Malmesbury he was planning to invade Aquitaine at the time of his death.\nQuestion: how long did it last for. Whats the answer?", "response": "The question seems to be asking about the duration of a particular event or period in William II's life, but it is not specific as to which event or period it is referring to. Here are a few durations related to events mentioned in the context:\n\n1. Reign as King of England: William II, also known as William Rufus, reigned as King of England from 1087 until his death in 1100, which is approximately 13 years.\n\n2. Robert Curthose's participation in the First Crusade: William's brother, Robert Curthose, joined the First Crusade in 1096. He did not return to Normandy until September 1100, which means his participation in the Crusade lasted around 4 years.\n\n3. William's regency in Normandy: As a regent for his brother in Normandy, William campaigned in France between 1097 and 1099, a period of about 2 years.\n\nIf you could provide more specific details about the event or period you are referring to, I would be glad to give you a more accurate answer regarding its duration.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_8000", "prompt": "In the year 2006, \"In Cold Blood\"-a riveting thriller from 1967-has two new interesting contexts that it did not previous have. First, and most chillingly, is the fact that it's star, Robert Blake, was recently on trial for murdering his wife. Second, the recent Oscar winning biopic, \"Capote\" showed the muddled back story of this haunting true crime tale's author, Truman Capote. These two new twists make the film timely for a modern audience.\n\nAs a stand alone film from it's era, \"In Cold Blood\" is top notch in every way. Most notable is the stunning black and white cinematography from Conrad Hall (later of \"American Beauty\" and \"Road to Perdition\" fame). Many of the stills from this film of the Kansas farm house at night or the tree-lined back country roads could be sold as fine art photography. Combined with the cracker-jack direction from Brooks and superb editing in the early scenes (where we see the mundane daily life of the innocent family about to be senselessly slaughtered beautifully intertwined with the plotting of the two hapless killers), a rich brooding atmosphere is created that sets the stage for riveting suspense (even when everyone knows how this is all going to end due to the fact its all based on real life events). It's also great to see in this day and age how brilliantly staged a harrowing murder scene can be depicted where the graphic nature of the act is transmitted to the viewer subliminally with nary a drop of blood shown on screen.\n\nThe film is also anchored nicely by Robert Blake's eerie performance as the more sympathetic yet senselessly brutal side of the killing duo. The flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done. Then there is the scene towards the end of the film where he is speaking to the reverend before being sent to the gallows and he makes his last \"confession\" so to speak. It's one of those classic movie moments that is a perfect marriage of gritty acting, superb writing, flawless direction, and haunting photography. I dare you to erase from your mind the stark image of the rain's reflection from the window flowing down Robert Blake's pallid face in lieu of actual tears.\n\nThe only thing hampering \"In Cold Blood\" is the slow moving middle act where the killers are on the lam and the forced nature of the social commentary at the end. The tacked-on political message about the death penalty is secondary to its compelling depiction of the mad killers and their prey.\nWould you say this review is positive or negative?\nChoose from: (i). negative; (ii). positive;", "response": "I would say this review is (ii). positive.", "token_count": 512}

Make the bed.", "response": "Title: How to Care for Your Bed: A Simple Guide for Little Helpers\n\nHey kids, did you know that taking care of your bed is easy and fun? It's an excellent way to help our moms and dads around the house. In this article, we will learn three simple steps to care for your bed. Let's make our beds the comfiest and coziest place to rest!\n\n1. Flip or Rotate the Mattress\n\nFirst, ask your mom or dad for help with this step. A mattress is the soft, squishy part of the bed that we sleep on. We need to flip (turn it over) or rotate (spin it around) the mattress to make it stay nice and comfy!\n\nImagine you have a yummy sandwich. After eating half of it, you might flip it over to have a taste of the other side. That's just like flipping a mattress! It helps to wear out both sides evenly and makes for a comfy night's sleep. And if you just spin it around like a fun game, that's rotating! This is helpful because sometimes we sleep in one spot for many nights, and rotating it helps the mattress wear out evenly too.\n\n2. Apply a Mattress Protector\n\nNext, we need a superhero to protect our mattress! Just kidding, we don't need a superhero. We need a mattress protector – a special cover that goes on top of the mattress. It's easy-peasy to put it on – just ask your mom or dad for help.\n\nA mattress protector is very important because it keeps our mattress clean from dirt, spills, and dust. Think about it like a shield that keeps our mattress safe and cozy. Putting on a mattress protector helps us sleep better and makes our mattress last longer too.\n\n3. Make the Bed\n\nNow that our mattress is flipped and protected, it's time to make the bed! Gather your bed sheets, pillows, and comforter. Start by laying the bedsheet over the mattress. Pretend you're tucking in your teddy bear for bedtime – make sure it's snug and not crinkly.\n\nNext, let's fluff those pillows! Give the pillows some fun little shakes and pats, so they become extra-plump and soft. Then, place them nicely at the head of the bed. Lastly, let's cover the bed with your comforter. Spread it out like a big hug over the bed, and make sure it's smooth and covers the whole mattress.\n\nThat's it! You've learned how to care for your bed in three easy steps: flipping or rotating the mattress, applying a mattress protector, and making the bed. Practice these steps with mom and dad, and soon, you'll be the best little helper in the house! Sweet dreams, kiddo!", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_908", "prompt": "Given the following context:  The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.  answer the following question:  Which old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house?\nThe answer to this question is:", "response": "The old house that was situated near the church in the garden of the present house is the manor of Belton, which was acquired by the Brownlow family in 1609 from the Pakenham family.", "token_count": 505}

Her parents file a lawsuit against the genetics company InGen, now headed by John Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow, who plans to use Isla Sorna to relieve the company of financial losses. Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm meets Hammond at his mansion. Hammond explains that Isla Sorna, abandoned years earlier during a hurricane, is where InGen created their dinosaurs before moving them to Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar. Hammond hopes to stop InGen by sending a team to Isla Sorna to document the dinosaurs, to help rally public support against human interference on the island. After learning that his girlfriend, paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding, is part of the team and is already on the island, Ian agrees to go to Isla Sorna, but only to retrieve her. Ian meets his teammates, Eddie Carr, an equipment specialist and engineer, and Nick Van Owen, a video documentarian. After arriving on the island, they locate Sarah and discover that Ian's daughter, Kelly, had stowed away in a trailer being used as a mobile base. They then watch as an InGen team of mercenaries, hunters and paleontologists led by Ludlow arrive to capture several dinosaurs. Meanwhile, team leader Roland Tembo hopes to capture a male Tyrannosaurus by luring it to the cries of its injured infant. That night, Ian's team sneak into the InGen camp and learn the captured dinosaurs will be brought to a newly proposed theme park in San Diego. This prompts Nick and Sarah to free the caged dinosaurs, wreaking havoc upon the camp. Nick also frees the infant T. rex and takes it to the trailer to mend its broken leg. After securing Kelly with Eddie, Ian realizes the infant's parents are searching for it and rushes to the trailer. As soon as Ian arrives, the infant's parents emerge on both sides of the trailer.

Todd, of Seaton Deleval, North Tyneside, pleaded guilty to fraud and perverting the course of justice. Judge John Evans sentenced her to six months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, with supervision. The judge said: 'It is a tragic tale of repeated manipulation, naked exploitation, betrayal and greed which befell Janet Brown and ultimately her vulnerable parents at the hands of a ruthless killer. 'It ended with the untimely death, the cold-blooded murder, of Janet Brown. 'Your part in this appalling tale was, I accept, as do the crown, limited. 'It needs to be recognised, it is accepted you did not know the truth about Janet. Had you done so, had that been established, I would have had to approach the question of sentence on a very different basis.' Judge Evans said he accepted Todd was 'vulnerable and naïve' when she 'blindly carried out his directions'. Glen Gatland, defending, said Todd could have been preyed on by the callous killer because of her physical resemblance to Miss Brown. Mr Gatland said: 'There is evidence he tired to persuade Elizabeth Todd, very shortly after their first meetings, to have her hair dyed to the same colour.' The court heard Todd believed Graham, who would profess his 'love and devotion' to her, would one day marry her - a belief that was backed up when he bought two engagement rings. Mr Gatland added: 'He was a very, very skillful conman, he was able to lead Elizabeth Todd up the garden path. He is skillful at using women. 'Elizabeth Todd believed Janet Brown was overseas and working. She genuinely believed what Donald Graham was telling her.' Graham is currently serving a life sentence, with a minimum term of 32 years, for Miss Brown's murder. Graham, 60, who lived with his wife Denise, sent letters and cards to Miss Brown's parents after he killed her, claiming to be Janet and telling them she had settled in Europe. He then went about gaining the trust of her parents, giving him access to banking information and personal documents. After the death of Janet's mother, Graham even took her father shopping each week while defrauding the family of hundreds of thousands of pounds. During the murder trial, the court heard he created a fake will for Janet's elderly father Eric Brown, which would leave his estate - Plane Trees Estate, in Hexham, Northumberland, to Graham. Eric Brown's will originally left all of his assets to Janet, but in the circumstance that he outlived her everything would be left to the Guide Dogs for the Blind charity. The court how Janet Brown and Elizabeth Todd had both been listed as witnesses on the fake will in which Graham forged Eric Browns signature. Skipton Building Society noticed suspicious activity on Eric Brown's account in 2009 and stopped the transaction of a cheque from Eric Brown to Donald Graham's account. This led to Graham writing letters to the bank claiming to be Eric and Janet Brown, although they were both dead. Todd admitted writing two of the letters, claiming to be Miss Brown and requesting cash be transferred immediately. When Graham was interviewed by police he claimed he was the joint executor of Eric Brown's will with Janet Brown. Donald Graham, of Elsdon Avenue, Seaton Deleval, Northumberland, was charged with 19 offences in September 13, 2013, nearly four years after the investigation began. He was charged with murder, two counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, 13 counts of fraud, forgery, conspiracy to commit fraud and perverting the course of justice. Todd pleaded guilty to fraud and perverting the course of justice and was handed a suspended sentence at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) He first appeared at Newcastle Crown Court on September 17 2013 and pleaded not guilty to all charges on January 10 2014. Graham changed his plea on March 14 and admitted 18 fraud offences against Janet Brown and her parents. He denied murder and preventing the course of justice but a jury at Newcastle Crown Court found him guilty of both counts on June 19. The total amount that Graham gained during the fraud was £585,000. Janet Brown lived with her elderly parents Olive and Eric Brown in a converted barn on her parents estate Plane Trees Farm, near Hexham, Northumberland. She had been planning to go on holiday in June 2005 to France with Graham, her lover of eight years. Graham cancelled at the last minute falsely claiming his wife was too ill for him to leave her. Janet told a friend that Graham had 'let her down'. However Graham had secretly met another girlfriend - Todd - and was no longer interested in Janet Brown, only her finances.

{"id": "example_4186", "prompt": "Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose work fell from favor during his later years? , can you please find it?   Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \"the tragedy of landscape\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his...\nAnswer:", "response": "The last name of the person whose work fell from favor during his later years is Friedrich.", "token_count": 495}

These two days make us think about the changing roles of mothers and fathers. More mothers now work outside the home. More fathers must help with child care. These two special days are celebrated in many different ways. On Mother's Day people wear carnations. A red one symbolizes a living mother. A white one shows that the mother is dead. Many people attend religious services to honor parents. It is also a day when people whose parents are dead visit the cemetery .On these days families get together at home, as well as in restaurants.

Hemos visto cómo ha escalado desde programas básicos hasta convertirse en un componente esencial de nuestros dispositivos cotidianos, desde teléfonos móviles hasta electrodomésticos.\n\nPara empezar, definiremos qué es la inteligencia artificial. La AI es una rama de las ciencias de la computación que tiene como objetivo crear máquinas capaces de interactuar con su entorno y llevar a cabo tareas que normalmente requieren de la inteligencia humana. Esto incluye aprender, analizar, comprender, razonar, utilizar el lenguaje y formular ideas.\n\nSu evolución ha sido fascinante.

{"id": "example_8117", "prompt": "Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Phospholipids As its name suggests, a phospholipid is a bond between the glycerol component of a lipid and a phosphorous molecule. In fact, phospholipids are similar in structure to triglycerides. However, instead of having three fatty acids, a phospholipid is generated from a diglyceride, a glycerol with just two fatty acid chains (Figure 2.23). The third binding site on the glycerol is taken up by the phosphate group, which in turn is attached to a polar “head” region of the molecule. Recall that triglycerides are nonpolar and hydrophobic. This still holds for the fatty acid portion of a phospholipid compound. However, the head of a phospholipid contains charges on the phosphate groups, as well as on the nitrogen atom. These charges make the phospholipid head hydrophilic. Therefore, phospholipids are said to have hydrophobic tails, containing the neutral fatty acids, and hydrophilic heads, containing the charged phosphate groups and nitrogen atom.

{"id": "example_2880", "prompt": "The Cars are an American rock band that emerged from the new wave scene in the late 1970s. The band originated in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1976, with singer, rhythm guitarist, and songwriter Ric Ocasek; singer, songwriter and bassist Benjamin Orr; lead guitarist Elliot Easton; keyboardist Greg Hawkes; and drummer David Robinson. The Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synthesizer-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flourish in the early 1980s. Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times and Rolling Stone, described the Cars' musical style by saying: \"they have taken some important but disparate contemporary trends--punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the '50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power pop--and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.\"\n\nIn 2010, the founding members of the Cars suggested a reunion when Ric Ocasek, Elliot Easton, Greg Hawkes and David Robinson placed a photo of the four members together in Millbrook Sound Studios, Millbrook, New York on their Facebook page. On October 13, they also posted a snippet of a new song, \"Blue Tip\", on their Facebook page. A picture of Jacknife Lee in the studio was posted on the group's Facebook page hinting that he would be producing the new Cars album.  In October Billboard reported that a new album which may be supported by a tour is being recorded at veteran engineer Paul Orofino's studio in Millbrook, New York. A music clip of a new song, called \"Sad Song\", was added to the band's Facebook page on December 7, 2010; another clip of a song called \"Free\" was shared on their Facebook page on January 1, 2011. The official debut video for \"Blue Tip\" was released February 17, 2011. The video was directed by Roberto Serrini and Eron Otcasek from The Lab NYC and features the four members of the band, and NYC based street artist Joe Iurato. According to Rolling Stone, the surviving Cars mutually agreed there would be no replacing the late Benjamin Orr, so Hawkes and Lee handled all bass parts.  The new album, titled Move Like This, was released on May 10 by Hear Music/Concord Music Group, debuting at No. 7 on Billboard's album charts. It featured 10 songs in under 40 minutes. The album's first single, \"Sad Song\", was released to radio stations March 1. In May 2011, the Cars went on a ten-city tour of the United States and Canada and also performed at Lollapalooza in Chicago in August.  Though the Cars have not broken up, they have been inactive since the tour's conclusion in 2011, and their website has not been updated since that time. Though on April 28, 2016 Ric Ocasek appeared on behalf of the Cars for a Q & A with SiriusXM satellite radio. 2016 has also seen a release of remastered Cars music on CD and vinyl.

However, considering the elements of the statement, it appears that the critic is leaning towards a somewhat positive opinion of the movie.\n\nThe word \"never\" implies that there wasn't a point in the movie where it felt hopelessly juvenile, meaning it did not come across as overly immature, childish, or unsophisticated. This suggests that the critic finds this aspect to be a positive trait in the movie.\n\nThe term \"hopelessly\" indicates a strong sense of negativity when associated with being juvenile. By stating that the movie never gave an impression of being hopelessly juvenile, the critic implies a certain level of depth and maturity present throughout the film, which they might appreciate in a movie.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this short review is open to interpretation and could be seen as a backhanded compliment. The critic may have potentially expected the movie to be juvenile or childish but was surprised to find that it never reached such a level. In that case, the critic might still be pointing out that the movie has some juvenile elements, but they do not overpower the experience.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the available information, it can be inferred that the critic most likely had a relatively positive view of the movie, thanks to it not being hopelessly juvenile.

So, it's reasonably valid to listen to what I say about my experience at The Shady Tavern, a place where I had the misfortune of spending an evening. With great disappointment, I pen this review to let potential visitors know the truth about this establishment and its reputation.\n\nFirst, let me shed some light on the location and ambiance. The Shady Tavern's name fits well, as it is situated in a dark, poorly lit alley that immediately evokes an eerie feeling. The establishment clearly has not been given much attention in terms of maintenance, with paint peeling off the walls, graffiti littered across its facade, and cigarette butts scattered on the ground near the entrance.\n\nUpon entering the tavern, one cannot help but notice the pungent combination of stale beer, dampness, and the unmistakable stench of sweat. This place desperately needs a deep clean to rid it of these unpleasant odors. The dim lighting inside only adds to the overall shady atmosphere, which feels more like a place for clandestine activities than a relaxing spot to unwind.\n\nOnce seated, it took an incredibly long time to get our server's attention. We were left unattended for nearly 20 minutes before we could even place our drink orders. When the server finally approached us, they seemed disheveled and disinterested, barely making any eye contact and showing no knowledge of the menu. The inattentive service persisted throughout the night, making it highly frustrating to get any refills, food orders, or even the simplest of requests attended to.\n\nNow, let's discuss the food and drinks—both of which can only be described as severely lacking in quality and taste. The food menu, while extensive, seemed to have confused quantity for quality. The dishes that were served to our table were at best mediocre and at worst inedible. The so-called \"gourmet burger\" was dry and overcooked, the \"Crispy Fried Chicken\" bore a suspicious resemblance to microwavable nuggets, and the \"Fresh Garden Salad\" was a sad assortment of wilted greens with a dressing that tasted like it came straight out of a bottle.\n\nAs for the drinks, one expects a tavern to have a reasonable beer selection and perhaps some decent options in terms of wine and cocktails. This was not the case at The Shady Tavern. The beer list consisted of just a handful of generic, non-craft options, all of which tasted lukewarm and stale. Attempting a cocktail was a gamble, as it seemed like the bartender had no training in mixology. The margarita was unbearably sweet, with barely a hint of tequila, while the so-called \"Old Fashioned\" ended up being a muddy, undrinkable concoction.\n\nTo top off the already unpleasant evening, the noise level was intolerable. It was clear that no effort was made to provide any sort of soundproofing or noise reduction. Conversations were impossible to maintain due to this unbearable cacophony, making it necessary to shout just to be heard by the person sitting next to you.\n\nOverall, my experience at The Shady Tavern was nothing short of disastrous. From the moment I arrived, everything about this place—from its dingy location to the subpar food and drinks, to the woefully inadequate service—left a bitter taste in my mouth. Do yourself a favor and avoid The Shady Tavern at all costs. There are plenty of other establishments that will give you much better value for your money and a memorable night that you would actually want to reminisce about.", "token_count": 512}

Lawrence had originally planned on being a dental hygienist.\n\nAs a comedian and actress, Lawrence is known for her work on The Carol Burnett Show, of which she was a part from 1967 to 1978. She was the only cast member, except for Burnett herself, who stayed on the show for the entire 11 seasons. After The Carol Burnett Show ended in 1978, Lawrence and her husband Al Schultz moved with their children to Maui, Hawaii, but after a few years, returned to Los Angeles, where they have remained.  Her portrayal of the Mama character on The Carol Burnett Show's \"The Family\" sketches was so popular that NBC subsequently created the sitcom Mama's Family, elaborating on the Mama character. (Burnett reprised the Eunice Higgins character for the sitcom from time to time.) The series ran from 1983 to 1985 on NBC; after its cancellation from NBC, it was renewed from 1986 to 1990 in first-run syndication. The show was more successful in the renewed version. She also reprised the Mama character on stage for Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show.  Lawrence has made appearances on other programs, such as the sitcoms Laverne & Shirley, Major Dad, Roseanne, Hannah Montana, and Yes, Dear.

{"id": "example_3851", "prompt": "Q:Given the background: The earliest members of the human species evolved around 200,000 years ago in Africa. Early humans lived in small populations of nomadic hunters and gatherers. Human beings remained in Africa until about 40,000 years ago. After that, they spread throughout Europe, Asia, and Australia. By 10,000 years ago, the first human beings colonized the Americas. During this long period of time, the total number of human beings increased very slowly. Birth rates were fairly high but so were death rates, producing low rates of population growth.  and the situation: Archaeologists studied data about human settlements. One was 100,000 years old called village R, and the other one was about 9,000 years old called village N. The older settlement was located in Africa, the other one wasn't.  Answer the following question: Which village had more people that were hunters?\nA:", "response": "Based on the background information provided, it is likely that Village R, the older settlement located in Africa 100,000 years ago, had more people who were hunters compared to Village N, the 9,000-year-old settlement. The reason behind this is that the earliest members of the human species evolved around 200,000 years ago in Africa, and they primarily lived as nomadic hunters and gatherers in small population groups. As humans spread and settled in different continents, their ways of living changed, leading to adaptations in their lifestyle and food practices.\n\nBy the time of Village N's existence (9,000 years ago), humans had already reached America, suggesting that other regions of the world underwent several cultural and technological advancements. During this period, the Neolithic Revolution was taking place, which led to the development of agriculture, animal domestication, and sedentary lifestyles. This would mean that the inhabitants of Village N were more likely to engage in farming and raising livestock as opposed to hunting and gathering.\n\nTherefore, Village R most likely had more people engaged in hunting compared to Village N.", "token_count": 447}

Some people believe bear bile has special magic to cure sickness, even though it's not really true. \n\nTo get this bile, the bad people were doing something very painful to the bears. This wasn't fair or nice and often made the bears very sick. Some poor bears even died from this terrible treatment, which is very, very sad. \n\nBut guess what, kiddos? Our story takes a happy turn!\n\nOne beautiful day, some brave helpers came and rescued all 14 bears from this mean farm. These helpers stopped the bad people from hurting the bears, and took the bears to a safer, kinder place where they can now live happily, playfully, just as all bears should. \n\nWhat's so extra special about this rescue? Well, this is the first time lots of bears were saved just because people felt it was the right thing to do. Some of the bad people realized how wrong they were, how much they were hurting the innocent bears, and willingly let the bears go to be happy and safe. It's like they finally listened to their heart that knew being good is better than being bad.\n\nFrom now on, these 14 moon bears will be free to do all the fun things they love - like munching on fruits, climbing trees, and of course, taking long naps under the big, shiny moon. Their rescue is a big reminder to all people to be kind to animals, to love them, and not hurt them in any way. After all, like us, animals too want to live happily and peacefully. \n\nSo next time, when you see an animal, remember to be gentle and kind. Because, sweetie, that's what real heroes do!", "token_count": 512}

In the first sentence, it is mentioned that Peterson fished alone in San Francisco Bay on Christmas Eve. The second sentence specifies the exact time he left his wife: \"at about 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 24.\" Thus, the second sentence provides more precise information about the time Peterson went fishing.\n\n2. Both sentences highlight that Peterson was alone while fishing. This suggests that the activity of fishing does not involve anyone else other than him.\n\n3.

He is either masochistically neurotic: This suggests that the person in question may have a tendency to engage in self-destructive or self-punishing behaviors, possibly due to underlying psychological issues.\n2. Or is figuring out how to extricate himself: This implies that the individual might be trying to find a way to remove himself from the current situation or predicament he is facing.\n\nNow, let's examine the follow-up statement:\n\n1. He might be paranoid: This statement introduces a new possibility that the person may be exhibiting excessive or irrational suspiciousness and distrust of others. It doesn't directly correlate with him being masochistically neurotic, but it provides an alternate view of the individual's behavior. However, it is worth noting that paranoia and neuroticism can sometimes coexist in an individual, complicating their psychological profile.\n2. But I'm not sure if he is trying to remove himself: This part of the statement shows uncertainty about whether or not the person is attempting to extract himself from the situation. While it references the second part of the initial observation, it introduces doubt and suggests that there might be other explanations for the individual's behavior.\n\nIn summary, the follow-up statement does follow the initial observation, but it expands upon it by introducing the possibility of paranoia and expressing some uncertainty about whether the individual is actually trying to remove himself from the situation. Although it does not directly address the idea of the person being masochistically neurotic, it offers an alternate perspective on the individual's mental state and motivations.", "token_count": 447}

Yes\n\nRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, with his extraordinary nose that can illuminate the way through inclement weather, has exhibited excellent navigation skills when leading Santa's sleigh. While the primary purpose of his glowing red nose is to provide a guiding light through challenging weather conditions, it can be deduced that Rudolph is skilled at leading Santa's reindeer team, which implies that he would also be able to guide the pack in clear weather. In clear weather, it may not be necessary for Rudolph to use his glowing red nose, but his role as the lead reindeer would still allow him to guide the team.\n\nNot only does Rudolph possess a distinct physical advantage in the form of his glowing red nose, but he has also earned the trust and confidence of Santa and the other reindeer.

Santa would not entrust Rudolph with the responsibility of leading the team if he lacked the aptitude for doing so in various types of weather, including clear conditions.\n\n Additionally, the story of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer depicts a character who demonstrates resilience, determination, and a resourceful spirit.

Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill  it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice.

{"id": "example_8440", "prompt": "I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem. Question: Why did the author say he wasn't a big fan of Vegas?

In fact, the paragraph describes the Beretta 93R as a \"selective-fire machine pistol,\" which implies that it has the capability to be fired in different firing modes, including fully automatic.\n\nSelective-fire firearms usually have multiple firing modes, typically including semi-automatic, burst-fire, and fully automatic firing options. In this case, the mention of \"Raffica\" (which translates to \"bursts\" in Italian) indicates that the Beretta 93R does have burst-fire capabilities, a feature that is usually associated with firearms that also have fully-automatic firing options.\n\nFurthermore, the Beretta 93R was designed for police and military use, these users would likely benefit from having both semi-automatic and fully automatic firing capabilities, thereby increasing the weapon's effectiveness and adaptability in various tactical scenarios. Additionally, the paragraph states that the 93R is derived from the semi-automatic Beretta 92, suggesting that the 93R was designed to add more firing capabilities to its semi-automatic predecessor.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided paragraph, we cannot conclude that the Beretta 93R cannot be fired as a fully automatic.

Options:  A. see king  B. hello  C. meow  D. drink water  E. live many years\nAnswer:", "response": "C. meow\n\nA detailed answer:\nTypically, a cat would be expected to say \"meow\" as it is the most common vocalization associated with felines. Cats may make various vocalizations, including meows, purrs, hisses, and growls, all of which serve different purposes depending on the cat's needs and emotions.\n\nOption A, \"see king,\" is nonsensical and unrelated to how a cat would typically communicate. Option B, \"hello,\" is a human greeting and not usually associated with the vocalizations made by a cat. Option D, \"drink water,\" also seems unrelated as it is a phrase in English and does not reflect the way a cat communicates with its environment. Option E, \"live many years,\" is an expression that may represent a wish for longevity, but again, it does not align with the way a cat typically vocalizes.\n\nThus, the best option in line with common sense is option C, \"meow.\" Cats use their meows to communicate with humans by expressing their needs, emotions, or seeking attention. Adult cats rarely meow to each other, and it is generally believed that they have adopted this form of communication specifically to interact with humans. Different tones, frequencies, and lengths of meows can communicate a range of emotions, from hunger, pain, or distress to friendliness, contentment, and even aggression.

West Bromwich Albion, commonly referred to as West Brom or WBA, is a professional football club based in West Bromwich, West Midlands, England. The club was founded in 1878 and currently competes in the English Premier League.\n\nThe colliery wheel on West Bromwich Albion's badge represents the club's historical connection to the coal mining industry in the West Midlands and their working-class roots. The West Bromwich area was once a thriving hub for coal mining during the industrial revolution, and this is reflected in the club's emblem as a tribute to its origins.\n\nWest Brom's current club badge has been in use since 2006 and is an updated version of their previous shield-shaped emblem. The primary elements of the badge, including the colliery wheel and the throstle bird, have been utilized in different configurations throughout the club's history. The throstle bird, a variety of song thrush, signifies the Hawthorns, the club's stadium, which was named after the hawthorn bushes that once occupied the site.\n\nThe club's colors, navy blue and white, are also prominently displayed on the badge, with the navy blue background signifying the blue skies that the miners hoped for when the colliery wheel was still in use. The white stripes represent the five founding members of the club who were all workers in the industrial sector.\n\nThroughout its history, West Bromwich Albion has enjoyed varying degrees of success and has a loyal and passionate fan base. Some of their notable accomplishments include winning the Football League First Division (now known as the Premier League) in 1919-20, five FA Cup titles, and one Football League Cup. Their most recent success came in the form of promotion to the Premier League after finishing second in the EFL Championship during the 2019-20 season.\n\nIn conclusion, the Premier League football team with a colliery wheel on its badge is West Bromwich Albion.

{"id": "example_2703", "prompt": "Answer the following question: An inventor seeks to create a new product that serves a specific need and fulfills a role that other products do not. Sometimes an inventor comes up with a wholly new idea, but more often inventions are simply improvements on an older design. With a little imagination and creativity  , an old idea can suddenly become something new. However, creating a new invention means much more than having a brilliant idea. A good designer follows the design process: identifying the challenge, researching and brainstorming ideas , designing a solution, testing and evaluating the ideas, and finally building the product. Designers also use science, math, technology, and engineering to design a tool that satisfies the need they identified. Anyone can be an inventor --even kids! For example, Chester Greenwood was just fifteen years old when he invented a product that changed his life. In fact, his idea was so good that his invention supported him for the rest of his life. You may not know his name, but you probably know his invention --earmuffs  ! The inspiration for his earmuff design came to Chester when he was ice-skating. His ears were cold, and he decided to find a way to keep them warm. With the help of his grandmother, he made a new product to protect his ears and at the age of eighteen, Chester patented his earmuff design. Many other famous inventors started young as well. Margaret Knight --the inventor of the flat-bottomed brown paper bag --is said to have created a safety device for textile looms  when she was just twelve years old. Another example is Thomas Edison, one of the greatest inventors in history, who applied for his first patent when he was just twenty-one years old. Over the course of his life, Thomas Edison patented a total of 1,093 inventions! The example of Chester Greenwood is used to show that   _  .

The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \"Straight Lines\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \"run the risk of losing fans\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\" in their careers. The band have received six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony., can you guess it ?\nA:", "response": "Based on the information provided in the article, the key people to the band's overall sound are Daniel Johns, Chris Joannou, and Ben Gillies.

I will provide you with an in-depth explanation for each question.\n\nQuestion 1: How do you tell if the quality of PU leather is good?\n\nTo determine the quality of PU (polyurethane) leather, consider the following factors:\n\n1. Texture: High-quality PU leather should have a consistent and smooth texture. Poor quality PU leather may have an inconsistent texture with visible defects or rough patches.\n\n2. Flexibility: Good quality PU leather should be flexible and able to bend without showing signs of cracking or peeling. When you fold or bend the material, it should return to its original shape without leaving any creases or wrinkles.\n\n3. Stitching: Check for neat, straight, and consistent stitching without any loose threads or unraveling. Uneven or frayed stitching can indicate poor quality.\n\n4. Finish: The surface of high-quality PU leather should have a uniform appearance and color. Look for any inconsistencies or blotches which may suggest low quality or poor dyeing processes.\n\n5. Smell: Good quality PU leather should have minimal or no chemical odors. A strong or unpleasant smell can sometimes indicate the use of low-quality materials or chemicals, or improper manufacturing techniques.\n\n6. Durability: To test the quality of the PU leather, try gently scratching the surface with your fingernail. High-quality PU leather should not show scratch marks or damage easily.\n\nQuestion 2: How is PU leather made?\n\nPU leather is made through a two-step process:\n\nStep 1: Producing the base material\nThe base material typically consists of polyester fibers or another fabric for reinforcement. This fabric is coated with a layer of adhesive to ensure proper bonding with the polyurethane.\n\nStep 2: Applying the polyurethane coating\nPolyurethane is mixed with additives and colorants to achieve the desired characteristics. This mixture is then applied to the base material using either a roller coating, spray, or knife-over-roller method. The thickness of the coating can vary depending on the desired characteristics of the final product. The PU layer is then cured at a specific temperature and time to bond it to the base material, creating a durable and flexible leather-like material.\n\nAfter these steps, additional processes such as embossing, dyeing, and finishing may be done to achieve different textures, patterns, or colors, to make the PU leather appear more similar to genuine leather.\n\nSo, the answer to the question, \"Would the answer to these two questions be the same?\" would be \"no,\" as they both require unique explanations to provide sufficient information on the topic.", "token_count": 512}

Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \"screen names\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.  - A regnal name, or reign name, is a name used by some monarchs and popes during their reigns, and used subsequently to refer to them. The term is simply the adjective \"regnal\", of or relating to a reign, monarch, or kingdom, modifying \"name\". Since ancient times, monarchs have frequently, but not always, chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number (ordinal), usually written as a Roman numeral (VI rather than 6), to provide a unique identification for that monarch among other monarchs of that realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden, George Tupou V of Tonga. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as they are each assigned chronologically, and some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name previously.

This significant wave of immigration took place mainly from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, and the choices of destinations were influenced by various factors such as employment opportunities, existing Italian communities, and family connections. \n\nBetween 1880 and 1924, approximately four million Italian immigrants arrived in the United States, with the majority of them coming from the impoverished regions of Southern Italy and Sicily. This population movement was driven primarily by factors such as poverty, limited prospects for social and economic mobility, and political instability in Italy. As a result, Italian immigrants sought better living conditions, jobs, and opportunities in other countries, primarily the United States.\n\nThe majority of these Italian immigrants settled in the northeastern urban areas, specifically in cities such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. These locations offered numerous employment opportunities, particularly in industries such as garment manufacturing, construction, mining, and railroad building. For instance, New York City, the most significant Italian immigrant destination in the United States, saw the establishment of several Italian neighborhoods within its boroughs, including Little Italy in downtown Manhattan, Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, and Arthur Avenue in the Bronx.\n\nItalian immigrants also made their way to other regions within the United States. In the Midwest, Chicago and Detroit attracted a sizable number of Italian immigrants, many of whom found employment in factories, automobile manufacturing, steel mills, and meatpacking. In the West, cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Denver saw the growth of Italian communities, as immigrants became involved in industries such as fishing, agriculture, and wine production.\n\nIn addition to economic opportunities, Italian immigrants often chose their destinations based on connections, family ties, and existing Italian communities. Chain migration played a crucial role in the settlement patterns of Italian immigrants, as they were more likely to choose cities and towns where friends and family members had already successfully established themselves. This sense of community and connection to their Italian heritage helped to create cultural enclaves and neighborhoods where the language, customs, and traditions of Italy were preserved and passed onto future generations.\n\nWhile the United States was the primary destination for Italian immigrants, other countries also saw an influx of Italians during this period, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and Australia. However, the United States remained the most popular destination due to its promise of economic prosperity, personal freedom, and a chance for a better life far away from the challenges and strife faced in Italy at the time. Today, the legacy of Italian immigration continues to shape the cultural, economic, and social fabric of the United States, as well as the lives of millions of Italian-Americans who call this country home.", "token_count": 512}

Players use a guitar - shaped controller ( purchased separately ) to simulate playing rock music by hitting notes as they scroll towards the player . Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series , rather than a full sequel . No changes in gameplay from Guitar Hero II have been introduced to this game . As implied by the game 's title , the game features a 1980s theme , consisting of songs from the decade and playable characters , fashions , and artwork that reflect the time period . The game was not as well - received as the prior two Guitar Hero games , due to the lack of new gameplay features and reduced soundtrack . Rocks the 80s is the third and final title in the Guitar Hero series to be developed by Harmonix before they moved on to create Rock Band . The next major installment of the series , Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock , was developed by Activision 's Neversoft division .  - A game controller is a device used with games or entertainment systems to provide input to a video game, typically to control an object or character in the game. A controller is usually connected to a game console or computer by means of a wire or cord, although, since the mid-2000s, wireless controllers have become widespread. Input devices that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mouses, gamepads, joysticks, etc. Special purpose devices, such as steering wheels for driving games and light guns for shooting games, are also game controllers.  - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion.   - Rhythm game or rhythm action is a genre of music-themed action video game that challenges a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads may be used as input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.

This new look was also noticed by his co-workers, who for the most part, considered him to be an infantile spoiled brat. It fit with their idea of a boss. And Benedykt was indeed the boss, even though he himself couldn't quite believe it. He was the head of a foundation for the self-promotion of the Ossolinsky family, well-known descendants of Polish-American aristocrats, engaged in business ventures there, and charity work here. The position was highly honorable and very prestigious. Just as the employees didn't like Benedykt, in equal measure Benedykt didn't like his job. He considered it extremely stressful and felt it forced him to super-human sacrifices. Everything was arranged by the family as a penance for avoiding work.

{"id": "example_1090", "prompt": "The organization that grants academic accreditation to Penn State has warned the school that it is in danger of losing that crucial status in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal, the university announced this week. The move by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education is the latest blow for the beleaguered university, which has seen its reputation clobbered and its football program hobbled after investigators found school leaders did too little to stop the abuse. Were the commission to pull Penn State's accreditation -- which it has not done -- the school would face the loss of eligibility for federal student aid programs, guaranteed student loans, federal research grants and could lose eligibility for state aid, commission spokesman Richard Pockrass said in July. Paterno family wants to appeal Penn State sanctions. Penn State will resolve the commission's concerns, promised Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Blannie Bowen. \"This action has nothing to do with the quality of education our students receive,\" Bowen said in a statement posted Monday to the school's website. \"Middle States is focusing on governance, integrity and financial issues related to information in the Freeh report and other items related to our current situation.\" The commission voted August 6 to place the school on warning status. Two days later, it notified Penn State officials that the school's accreditation was \"in jeopardy\" based on information contained in former FBI Director Louis Freeh's report on Penn State's handling of the sex-abuse allegations against Sandusky and a National Collegiate Athletic Association action against the school. Freeh found that Penn State's leadership showed \"total and consistent disregard\" for youths sexually abused by Sandusky, the former assistant football coach convicted by a jury in June on 45 counts involving child sex abuse. He is scheduled to be sentenced in September. Among other things, authorities say school officials failed to properly address a report that Sandusky had been seen in a football complex shower, apparently engaged in sexual contact with a young boy. Timeline of the Penn State scandal. Last month, the NCAA fined Penn State $60 million, banned the football program from bowl games for four years, stripped scholarships and took away the team's wins from 1998 to 2011. The commission also said it had insufficient evidence that Penn State officials had followed commission rules about how schools are to be governed and whether it had provided \"accurate, fair and complete information\" about what was happening at the school, according to the letter. The commission asked Penn State to report by September 30 on the steps it is taking to ensure full compliance with accreditation requirements, as well as information about the school's financial capacity to meet ongoing obligations considering the potential fallout from civil lawsuits expected over the scandal. A team assembled by the commission will visit Penn State after the September report to evaluate the school's performance, the commission said. Bowen said the commission \"wants us to document that steps we have already taken and are planning to take will ensure our full compliance with its requirements\" and emphasized that the school expects no loss of accreditation. \"It is critical to emphasize that Middle States does not issue a warning unless the commission believes that an institution has the capacity to make appropriate improvements within a reasonable period and then sustain itself to stay in compliance,\" Bowen said in the statement. \"This certainly is true for Penn State. We're confident that our monitoring report and the site visit will confirm this to the commission.\" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the warning seemed to be a bit of \"piling on\" in light of the sanctions already in place against Penn State. But it may be another factor to further motivate the university to comprehensively deal with the scandal, he said on CNN's \"Starting Point.\" \"It all creates pressure on Penn State to make sure it has policies in place to make sure nothing like this ever happens again,\" Toobin said.

As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize, according to 2012 FAOSTAT data. Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Wild rice, from which the crop was developed, may have its native range in Australia. Chinese legends attribute the domestication of rice to Shennong, the legendary emperor of China and inventor of Chinese agriculture.

Creativity is an essential skill that plays a vital role in all aspects of life, including academic performance, problem-solving, and emotional well-being. Several factors have been identified as having an impact on children's creativity, such as family environment, cultural backgrounds, educational institutions, and leisure activities. Furthermore, the availability of adequate resources, technology, and exposure to arts and sciences are factors believed to directly impact children's creative potential.\n\nOne influential aspect that has not been extensively studied is the impact of time spent outdoors in natural environments on the development of creativity in children. With the growing prevalence of technology and structured indoor activities, it has become more important than ever to understand if time spent in nature can positively affect the process of creative development and cognitive flexibility in children.\n\nHypothesis: Spending more time in natural environments has a positive effect on the development of creativity in children, as outdoor activities and exposure to nature provide enhanced cognitive stimulation, boost the ability to think divergently, and foster emotional well-being, ultimately leading to an increased creative potential.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, researchers would need to design a study examining the relationship between time spent in natural environments and the development of children's creativity. Participants would be recruited from various ages and cultural backgrounds, and assessments would be made based on their exposure to natural environments and their performance on standardized creativity measurement tools. Comparisons could be drawn between children who frequently engage with nature and children with minimal exposure. The results of such a study would not only shed light on the impact of natural environments on creativity but could also guide future educational and parenting strategies to nurture the creative potentials of their children.", "token_count": 370}

Should I validate this answer?\nThe answer is:", "response": "No, the suggested answer is not valid for the question provided as it does not address the actual inquiry regarding the effect of egg substitutes on a cake. Let me provide a detailed answer to the proper question:\n\nThe question asked is about the impact of using egg substitutes on a cake and whether one should validate or consider this potential change in ingredients. When using egg substitutes in a cake recipe, several factors should be taken into consideration:\n\n1. Binding and Structure: Eggs play a significant role in binding the ingredients together and providing structure to the cake. Egg substitutes may vary in the strength of their binding ability, which could result in a difference in the overall texture and structure of the cake.\n\n2. Moisture: Eggs provide moisture to the cake, which is crucial for a soft and tender texture. Depending on the specific egg substitute used, the moisture content might be affected. Some substitutes may retain more moisture, leading to a denser cake, while others may not provide enough moisture, resulting in a drier cake.\n\n3. Leavening: Eggs contribute to the leavening process in cakes, which helps to achieve the desired rise and light, airy texture. Egg substitutes may have different leavening abilities due to their chemical composition, so using a substitute could affect the cake's rise and overall fluffiness.\n\n4. Flavor and Color: Eggs not only affect the cake's texture but also contribute to its flavor and color. Using an egg substitute might slightly alter the taste and appearance of the cake, depending on the specific type of substitute used.\n\n5. Potential Allergies and Dietary Restrictions: Some individuals may have egg allergies or follow a dietary lifestyle that excludes eggs, such as veganism. In these cases, using egg substitutes is necessary to accommodate these needs, and it is essential to find an adequate substitute that will achieve the desired outcome for your specific cake recipe.\n\nIt is essential to validate and choose the appropriate egg substitute based on the specific cake recipe you are working on. There are several egg substitutes available on the market, as well as homemade alternatives such as applesauce, yogurt, mashed bananas, or silken tofu, among others. Each of these substitutes has its unique characteristics, and some may be more suitable for specific types of cakes. For example, silken tofu may work well for dense, moist cakes, while baking powder and vinegar mixture could be a more appropriate choice for lighter cakes.\n\nIn conclusion, using egg substitutes in a cake could affect its structure, texture, flavor, and appearance. It is crucial to consider the desired outcome and specific recipe requirements to choose an appropriate egg substitute that will yield the best results.", "token_count": 512}

Context: It is remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since in many cases it is hundreds, and in a few instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk.

The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process. Speaking at a news conference in Seoul alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, the U.S. secretary of state said the Trump administration would not repeat the mistakes made by past presidents that rewarded Pyongyang for denuclearization promises. “When we refer to the mistakes of the past. They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,” Pompeo said. President Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements. Pompeo, however, pointed out that in the Singapore statement both countries reaffirmed the inter-Korean Panmunjom declaration from April, in which both South and North Korea agreed to uphold all past agreements that did specify detailed nuclear prohibitions and verification requirements.

This event happened the first summer after we moved to the mountains of Colorado. Wanting to enjoy the beauty of the mountains, my wife and I planned a day hike to the Brown's Creek waterfall. The kids were excited--a day hike, a chance to experience a waterfall, and a day spent with Dad and Mom. Our hike would take us up the Brown's Creek trail   and after about 3 miles the waterfall would be on our left. After slowly climbing the first mile, the trail took us through a beautiful grassland and across the creek   a couple of times. We decided to turn back before reaching the waterfall, mostly because we were tired and still didn't know how much farther  _ was. While crossing the creek by walking on a downed tree trunk, our little Izzie fell into the creek and immediately started moving up and down in the current  . Immediately, I jumped into the creek after her. I managed to grab her and push her to the bank. But now, I was the one in need of being rescued. I thought this might be the end and I wasn't sure if I could hold on. Then, I heard the voice of the love of my life, my wife's voice. She shouted loudly--Stand up! Stand up! With the last bit of strength I had, I stood, and walked out of the creek. The kids showed little concern for my health; they were looking after Izzie, now safe in their arms. But I did hear one of the kids say: Thanks Dad, for saving Izzie. You're our HERO! As we walked back down the trail, I enjoyed a rare, but one of those sweet moments in life, that I wouldn't trade for anything on earth. I didn't care about my wet clothes, the squish   of water in my boots, or the embarrassment of nearly drowning in water; none of that mattered.

The detailed and long answer is as follows:\n\n1. Egg stage: The life cycle of a butterfly begins with the female butterfly laying eggs on a suitable host plant, usually the one that provides an ideal food source for the soon-to-be-hatched caterpillars. The eggs are small, often shaped like tiny spheres or ovals, and are laid either singularly or in clusters, depending on the species. The eggs are equipped with a protective outer layer called the chorion, which keeps them safe from environmental fluctuations and predators. Additionally, a layer of fluid is present between the egg and the chorion for further nourishment.\n\n2. The caterpillar/larval stage (mentioned in the question): Once the eggs hatch, the caterpillars emerge with a voracious appetite. In this stage, their main purpose is to consume food, specifically the leaves of the designated host plant, allowing them to grow rapidly. As they grow, the caterpillars molt or shed their outer layer of skin multiple times to accommodate their increasing size.\n\n3. Cocoon formation/chrysalis stage (mentioned in the question): After reaching an optimal size, the caterpillar finds a safe location to begin spinning a cocoon, also known as a chrysalis or pupa, around itself. The cocoon is constructed from silk, which is secreted by the caterpillar's spinneret glands. The cocoon serves as a protective covering while the caterpillar undergoes a remarkable transformation called metamorphosis.\n\n4. Pupa stage (mentioned in the question): Inside the cocoon, the caterpillar's body breaks down and rearranges itself into the adult butterfly form. This stage can last anywhere from a few days to several months, depending on the species and environmental conditions. During this time, the caterpillar undergoes significant changes, including the development of wings, compound eyes, and a more slender body.\n\n5. Adult butterfly/emergence (mentioned in the question): After the metamorphosis is complete, the adult butterfly emerges from the cocoon. In this stage, the butterfly is fully formed, displaying intricate patterns and vibrant colors on its wings. Shortly after emerging, the butterfly's wings will be soft and must be expanded by pumping a fluid called hemolymph through the wing veins, after which they will harden, allowing the butterfly to fly.\n\n6. Reproduction: As adult butterflies, their primary purpose is now to find a mate and reproduce, ensuring the continuation of their species. The entire life cycle begins anew as the female lays her eggs on a suitable host plant.", "token_count": 512}

It was a time of significant change and development in various aspects of society, including architecture, literature, and decorative arts, specifically furniture design.\n\nJacobean design was heavily influenced by the preceding Elizabethan style, however, it also incorporated elements from other European and, to some extent, even Eastern design aesthetics. Furniture crafted during this era has several distinctive features, such as:\n\n1. Dark wood: Primarily oak, which was abundant, durable, and a status symbol, was the preferred choice for furniture construction. The dark color came from aging or staining the oak to give it a prestigious look.\n\n2. Intricate carvings: Skilled craftsman adorned the furniture with elaborate carvings that were often influenced by the popular motifs of the time. Common themes included heraldic symbols, floral designs, cherubs, and biblical scenes.\n\n3. Bulbous legs: Jacobean furniture frequently featured thick, turned legs with a bulbous or trumpet-shaped profile. This was a departure from the straight, smooth legs of the Elizabethan era.\n\n4. Upholstery: High-quality textiles, such as velvet, leather, or brocade, often accompanied the furniture, with intricate embroidery and decorative elements. These expensive materials underscored the wealth and status of the furniture's owner.\n\n5. Straight lines and geometric forms: Jacobean furniture emphasized simplicity and linear design, with excellent craftsmanship evident in the construction of joints and overall balance and proportion.\n\n6. Smaller scale: Unlike the grandiose furnishings of the Elizabethan period or later Baroque period, Jacobean furniture tended to be more modest in size and decoration, reflecting a shift in architectural design towards smaller, more intimate spaces.\n\nToday, Jacobean-style furniture continues to be admired and collected for its historical significance, unique design features, and skilled artistry. These pieces serve as a testimony to the creativity and craftsmanship of the era and offer a glimpse into the decorative tastes of the period during the reign of King James I.", "token_count": 512}

For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better.

I laughed and told him, 'I never said so.' He asked me if I could play jazz and I said yes. He asked me if I could take solos and I said yes again.\" That's how Tony Allen details his first ever encounter with Fela Kuti back in the mid-1960s, a meeting that was destined to trigger an explosive sonic collaboration that a few years later gave birth to the blistering Afrobeat sound -- arguably the most exciting period in the history of popular West African music.\n\nIn the end, Allen says it was not the ongoing pay disputes but the increasingly volatile situation around Fela's political activism that led to", "response": "his departure from the band in 1979. As Fela continued to use his music as a platform to challenge military dictatorship and government corruption in Nigeria, tensions between the band and the authorities escalated, culminating in a series of violent police raids, arrests, and a tragic attack on Fela's commune, known as the Kalakuta Republic.\n\nDuring this turbulent period, the atmosphere surrounding the band became increasingly hostile and dangerous. In addition to the police harassment, there were internal conflicts within the band, as some members struggled to cope with the escalating violence and constant scrutiny. Despite their phenomenal success and the groundbreaking nature of their music, it became clear that the band's future was in jeopardy.\n\nIt was around this time that Tony Allen decided it was time to move on and forge his own career. He relocated to London, where he formed a new band called the Tony Allen Organization and began to collaborate with other artists, exploring different musical styles and genres. This marked a major turning point in his career, as he stepped out of Fela's shadow and began to establish himself as an acclaimed musician in his own right.\n\nIn the years that followed, Allen continued to perform and record with various artists from around the world, further expanding his musical range and influence. He developed a unique fusion of Afrobeat, jazz, and electronic music, making him a sought-after contributor to numerous projects, and enabling him to work with notable musicians like Damon Albarn, Grace Jones, and Jeff Mills, among others.\n\nSimultaneously, Fela Kuti's political activism continued to intensify, as he became an increasingly prominent and outspoken figure in Nigeria's struggle for democracy. Despite serving multiple jail terms and facing ongoing persecution from the authorities, Fela remained a vital and influential voice for change in his country, inspiring a new generation of musicians and activists. Sadly, Fela passed away in 1997, leaving a profound musical and socio-political legacy that continues to resonate today.\n\nAs for Tony Allen, his groundbreaking work in Afrobeat and his innovative collaborations with other artists ensured that his impact extended well beyond his time with Fela Kuti. He released a series of successful solo albums, and in 2006, he was invited to join the influential band The Good, the Bad & the Queen, with Damon Albarn, Paul Simonon, and Simon Tong – further testament to his enduring musical prowess.\n\nAllen's perseverance and immense talent enabled him to navigate the challenges and setbacks of his career, ultimately carving out a remarkable and enduring artistic legacy. His death in April 2020 was met with an outpouring of tributes from musicians and fans alike, highlighting the lasting influence of both his work with Fela Kuti and his rich, innovative contributions to the world of music.\n\nIn conclusion, the most logical completion of the news story would be that Tony Allen's departure from Fela Kuti's band was primarily due to the volatile political situation and his desire to explore new musical horizons.

{"id": "example_6718", "prompt": "I am an introvert. How can I control my emotions in a better way?\n\nHow do I control emotions and reactions in nervousness?\n\nPlease tell me if those questions are the same.", "response": "The two questions you're asking are related but not exactly the same. Both pertain to emotional regulation, though they approach it from slightly different angles. Let's break them down for clarity.\n\n\"I am an introvert. How can I control my emotions in a better way?\" This question focuses on general emotional control from an introverted point of view. Introverts often internalize their feelings and process them internally, and this can sometimes be overwhelming. They might have difficulty with outward expression of their emotions, which can lead to internal turmoil.\n\nHere are some strategies for controlling emotions as an introvert:\n\n1. Understanding Introversion: Recognize that as an introvert, you process situations and emotions internally. Being aware of this can help you understand when you're beginning to feel overwhelmed and take steps to address your feelings.\n\n2. Work With Your Energy Levels: Introverts may find some social situations draining, not necessarily because they are shy or have social anxiety, but because they expend energy in social situations and need solitary time to recharge. If you know a demanding situation is coming up, try to \"charge your batteries\" beforehand and allow time to recuperate afterward.\n\n3. Develop Emotional Awareness: Take time to identify your emotions and their causes. Emotion-focused coping strategies like journaling or mindfulness exercises can help you understand your feelings at a deeper level.\n\n4. Practice Expressing Your Feelings: If you're comfortable with a friend, family member, or therapist, try articulating your feelings. This can often help introverts manage emotional extremes.\n\n5. Create a Comfort Environment: Introverts tend to function best in quiet, controlled environments. Try to create such spaces in your life where you can retreat, recharge and recalibrate your emotional equilibrium.\n\nSecond question, \"How do I control emotions and reactions in nervousness?\" is more about anxiety and nervous response control. This question leans towards understanding how to control emotional reactions when specifically experiencing nervousness or tension, which anyone, whether an introvert or an extravert, might grapple with.\n\nHere are some strategies to control emotions when you're feeling nervous:\n\n1. Deep Breathing: One of the simplest methods to control your emotional reaction is by taking deep, slow breaths. This can calm your mind and reduce anxiety.\n\n2. Mindfulness and Meditation: These practices can help you stay centered and focused in the present moment, reducing feelings of nervousness or anxiety.\n\n3. Positive Self-Talk: Changing your internal dialogues can have a significant impact on your emotional state. Re-frame negative thoughts and worries into positive, encouraging dialogues.\n\n4. Gradual Exposure: If you're nervous about a specific thing or situation, gradual exposure (systematically and gradually facing the source of your fear) can be an effective strategy. This can help you build confidence and reduce anxiety overtime.\n\n5. Seek Professional Help: If your nervousness has become chronic or debilitating, you might benefit from seeking help from a mental health professional.\n\nIn conclusion, while both questions deal with emotional regulation, the first is about managing emotions as an introvert in general, and the second concerns managing emotions in specific situations of nervousness or anxiety.", "token_count": 512}

This bag will be used as the heating pad, so it should be soft and comfortable when placed against the skin.\n\nStep 2: Fill the sack with uncooked rice, leaving enough space for the rice to move around and distribute evenly within the bag. You can also add a few drops of essential oils like lavender for added relaxation, if desired.\n\nStep 3: Seal the sack properly, ensuring that no rice can spill out. This is important for microwave safety and cleanliness.\n\nStep 4: Microwave the rice-filled sack on a microwave-safe plate. Start with a low power setting and warm the bag for about one minute. Check the temperature of the bag carefully to avoid burns and overheating. If it is not warm enough, continue microwaving in 15-30 second increments, checking the temperature after each interval until it reaches the desired warmth.\n\nStep 5: Place the warm rice heating pad on the affected area to alleviate period pain and discomfort.\n\nOption 2 is better than Option 1 because microwaving rice in a bowl can lead to uneven heating, spillage, and difficulty in applying the rice directly to the affected area.

And even if he’s going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him.\" \n  \n The line got applause and sent the wonks on Twitter aflutter, but it left most people drawing a blank: What's wage insurance? \n  \n Politics Newsletter Sign up to receive the day’s top political stories. View Sample SIGN UP NOW \n  \n In a nutshell, it's a government entitlement that keeps low- and middle-income workers' wages from dropping below a certain benchmark. \n  \n Unlike unemployment insurance, which attempts to provide a buffer for workers that have temporarily and involuntarily lost their jobs, wage insurance protects workers against future losses in earnings too, in case they have no choice but to accept a lower-paying job in order to get re-employed. \n  \n Read More: President Obama Puts Joe Biden in Charge of Curing Cancer \n  \n Unlike universal income, which is a mostly liberal-backed idea that would provide a standard wage to every American regardless of employment status, wage insurance would only be accessible to working people who involuntarily lost a job and then got another, less-well-paying one. \n  \n In the past, support for wage insurance has actually been pretty bipartisan. Democrats liked it because it's a government entitlement aimed squarely at working and middle-class Americans, and Republicans liked it because it requires that people keep working — even if it means taking the first job they can get. \n  \n Most existing wage-insurance proposals — which, for the most part, languish in think-tank archives — have built-in ways to keep people from gaming the system. For example, some proposals suggest calibrating payouts so that no American would voluntarily be on wage insurance: if it was possible for you to get a better-paying job, it would be in your economic interest to snag it. \n  \n Other proposals suggest that it would apply only to salaries below a certain salary level. So if you're making $200,000 and you lose your job and get a new one that pays you only $150,000, then this program isn't for you. \n  \n Wage insurance became popular among the economic intelligentsia about 25 years ago, right about when it became apparent that powerful forces in the modern economy — free trade, globalization, technologization — were both juicing the national GDP and permanently eliminating good, American jobs (and replacing them with less good, lower-paying ones). \n  \n Read More: Obama Puts Terrorism in Perspective in State of the Union \n  \n For example, bank tellers, which used to be paid relatively well, have seen their ranks decimated by the ATM. While that might be good for the economy writ large — think of all those ATM repairmen! — it's not good for that individual bank teller, who now works as, say, a dishwasher, making significantly less. \n  \n Wage-insurance aficionados argue that the answer to that conundrum is not to try to stop those larger market forces — we can't stick a wrench in the rapid advance of technology — but to take the gains that those forces deliver to the larger economy and reinvest them into working Americans' salaries. \n  \n If that former bank teller used to make $700 a week and now makes $450 as a dishwasher, then wage insurance would compensate some portion of those lost wages — keeping the worker above the poverty line. ||||| President Obama on Tuesday night called for a system of wage insurance to alleviate the problem of job loss. \n  \n Obama in his State of the Union address talked about the need for greater economic security and cast wage insurance as a policy that could complement the existing program of unemployment benefits. \n  \n Not only should laid-off workers receive unemployment insurance, Obama said, but they should also be encouraged to get training for a new job. \n  \n \"If that new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills,\" Obama said. \n  \n Existing wage insurance proposals involve a levy placed in addition to the unemployment insurance tax that would be used to subsidize wages for workers who were laid off and then subsequently found a lower-paying job. The idea behind the policy would be to encourage people to quickly move into new work and begin rebuilding their job skills. \n  \n The wage insurance idea is one of the few specific economic policy proposals Obama mentioned in his speech, but it is not a new one for him. He called for versions of wage insurance in the American Jobs Act legislation he backed in 2011 and in his 2012 State of the Union address. \n  \n Those calls, however, did not translate into legislative success. |||||", "response": "During a big speech, President Obama talked about ways the government can help people who don't have jobs.

In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was $5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America.

Question: suppose there are more nerves in the brain happens, how will it affect more viruses are attached to a cell's surface.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect\nThe answer to this question is:", "response": "A: more\n\nWhen there are more nerves in the brain, it not only increases the total number of cells available for viral invasion but also provides a larger surface area for viruses to attach to. This makes it easier for viruses to find and infect host cells, leading to a higher likelihood of more viruses attaching to a cell's surface.\n\nIn the given process, once a virus finds an animal cell, it attaches to the cell's surface. As the number of neurons in the brain increases, there are more targets for the virus to infect. Since animal cells have a wide variety of unique surface receptors, the increased number of neuronal cells leads to the presence of more such receptors.\n\nAdditionally, it is essential to consider the virus's specificity to different cell types and its ability to infect them. As the number of neurons in the brain grows, it might increase specific neuronal cell types' abundance that the virus can more efficiently infect. This further raises the chances of more viruses attaching to the cell's surface.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the number of neurons may impact the likelihood of more viruses attaching to a cell's surface, this is only one factor in viral infection and replication. Other aspects, such as the individual's immune system, overall health, and the specific type of virus, would also have significant roles in determining the overall outcome of a viral invasion.\n\nIn summary, in a scenario in which there are more nerves in the brain, it would likely result in more viruses attaching to a cell's surface due to the increased number of available target cells and surface receptors.

{"id": "example_11678", "prompt": "-  An area of low pressure causes rotation - Several thunderstorms come together around this area - The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating - When the wind speeds reach 74 mph the storm is considered a hurricane.  What might be the first step of the process?\nAnswer:", "response": "The first step in the process of hurricane formation involves the development of a weather disturbance within a tropical region, characterized by low atmospheric pressure and favorable environmental conditions. This weather disturbance is typically caused by the convergence of warm, moist air that rises from the surface of the ocean. As the warm air ascends, it cools and condenses, forming clouds and releasing latent heat, which in turn warms the surrounding air and encourages further condensation. This cycle of rising air and condensation leads to the development of an area of low pressure, which plays a critical role in initiating the rotation necessary for a hurricane to form.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the formation of this low-pressure system, including the Earth's rotation, which imparts the Coriolis effect that causes the winds to rotate around the center of the disturbance. Also, the presence of a pre-existing weather system, such as a tropical wave or a low-pressure trough, can help trigger the initial convergence of warm, moist air.\n\nOnce this area of low pressure and rotation is established, thunderstorms begin to develop and cluster around the central region of the disturbance. As these thunderstorms continue to strengthen and feed off the warm ocean water, they release more heat into the atmosphere, causing the air pressure within the system to drop even further. This drop in pressure intensifies the winds around the storm system, ultimately leading to the development of a tropical cyclone.\n\nWhen the sustained wind speeds within the tropical cyclone reach 74 mph (119 km/h) or higher, the storm is officially classified as a hurricane. These powerful storms pose significant risks to coastal regions due to their capacity for producing heavy rainfall, damaging winds, and storm surges, which can lead to widespread flooding and destruction.\n\nIn summary, the first step of the hurricane formation process is the development of a tropical weather disturbance, marked by low atmospheric pressure and the convergence of warm, moist air. This disturbance sets the stage for the growth and intensification of the storm system, eventually leading to the formation of a hurricane.", "token_count": 481}

{"id": "example_2861", "prompt": "Process: - A bird lays an egg - The egg hatches into a baby bird - Baby bird eats - Grows into an adult bird - The bird finds a mate - The pair build a nest - The birds lay eggs.  Question: suppose there is very little human interference happens, how will it affect more eggs hatch.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect", "response": "To approach this task, we need to evaluate the impact of human interference on the bird's lifecycle mentioned in the process. Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1) Understanding the scenario: The scenario details the life cycle of a bird, from laying eggs to the next generation of birds. We need to predict the effect of minimal human interference on the number of eggs hatching.\n\n2) Considering biological factors: In a natural environment without human interference, birds will follow their normal lifecycle - laying eggs, the emergence of baby birds, their growth, finding a mate, nest-building, and laying eggs by the next generation. Essentially, birds have evolved to do this on their own.\n\n3) Considering the impact of human interference: Human interference can have both negative and positive impacts on a bird’s life. On the negative side, it could lead to habitat destruction, disturbance during nesting, or even direct harm to the birds, which could decrease the chance of eggs hatching or the survival of the chicks. On the positive side, the human activity might involve providing safe nesting places, providing food, or protecting birds from predators, which could increase the chances of survival.\n\n4) Thinking about reduced human interference, it is plausible that based on the positive impacts mentioned earlier, less human activity could potentially lead to a decline in the number of eggs hatching, since there would be less protection and aid given to the birds. However, decreasing human activity would also mean less of the negative impacts, like birds’ habitat destruction, and thus could potentially be beneficial for the birds.\n\n5) Evaluating the likely outcome: This question is somewhat complex as it depends on the kind of human interference the bird populations are subjected to. If human interference majorly involves negative impacts like habitat destruction, less interference would mean more birds surviving and hence, more eggs hatching. Alternatively, if human interference is primarily protective, less interference could lead to fewer eggs hatching. \n\nHowever, since most wild birds have naturally evolved to survive without human assistance, and the negative human impact due to urbanization and deforestation is generally more widespread, it is likely that with very little human interference, the hatching of eggs for wild birds may increase. \n\nTherefore, option A) \"more\" could be the most suitable answer.", "token_count": 512}

(i) Consider purchasing microwaves, which power energy at a rate of 100 percent. Protect the amount of energy you use in the household by using the energy star designation when you're doing something else.. (ii) This is a moderately low-heat oven that allows more power to be used. This is going to consist significantly more energy than it would if the oven itself were about 1 kilowatt.. (iii) A convection oven functions to heat up the air all around the food. This means that the food will heat up faster quickly, which in turn results in fewer calories hitting your food.. (iv) Convection ovens work better the more surface area the food has. That is, they will work better on cookies or muffins than banana bread..", "response": "(iv) Convection ovens work better the more surface area the food has. That is, they will work better on cookies or muffins than banana bread. This means you should adapt your cooking methods based on the appliance and type of food to conserve energy. Denser foods such as banana bread or meat loaves might take more time and energy to cook, as the heat needs to penetrate deeper. Conversely, food items with more surface area heat up and cook more quickly in a convection oven due to the movement of hot air, saving energy.\n\nFurther, you can adopt some more efficient cooking practices with a convection oven. For example, you can cook multiple dishes at once. Since food cooks faster in a convection oven, you can efficiently utilize the space and energy. This would result in a significant reduction of energy use in comparison to cooking single dishes one after another. Additionally, try to avoid opening the oven door frequently when cooking, as every time the door is opened, heat escapes, making the appliance work harder and use more energy.\n\nMoreover, it's not just the oven you can optimize for energy usage. There are many other ways you can reduce energy use in the kitchen. For instance, using smaller appliances such as toaster ovens or microwave ovens for small meals rather than the large conventional oven; using pressure cookers, which take less time and thus save energy; or making sure your appliances are in good working order, as damaged appliances can lead to increased energy usage.\n\nMoreover, good planning and strategic appliance use can also lead to greater energy savings. For example, if you run your dishwasher at night, you'll be using electricity at a time when there's less demand and hence, the cost is lower. Or, in winter, you can exploit the heat from the oven spill-over to help heat the house.\n\nLast but not least, be mindful of your refrigerator usage. Try to decide what you need before you open the fridge door to reduce the amount of time that it remains open, and thus the amount of energy wasted. Also, allow hot foods to cool down before you put them in the refrigerator to avoid making it work harder to keep things cold.\n\nThrough these steps, you can significantly reduce energy use in your kitchen, leading to lower energy bills and a more sustainable household.", "token_count": 512}

The 22-year-old, who has made his mark as an emerging talent with Brazilian club Cruzeiro, was signed for a hefty transfer fee of £11.5 million. Silva has put pen to paper on a contract that will see him donning the famous white jersey until 2020.\n\nLucas Silva's arrival in the Spanish capital is expected to provide much-needed cover for central-midfielder Toni Kroos, as the promising youngster gains first team experience in one of the most competitive leagues in world football. Known for his composed style, excellent ball control, and ability to dictate the tempo of games from the midfield, Silva is touted as one of Brazil's brightest young stars and is expected to adapt well to the pressure of playing for a top European club like Real Madrid.\n\nSilva's signing may have broader implications for the future of the current Real Madrid squad, indicating that the club is preparing to clear the decks for the Brazilian sensation. This could signal the impending departures of Asier Illarramendi and Sami Khedira, two midfielders who have found themselves on the fringes of first-team action this season. Illarramendi, a fellow Real Madrid youth product, has struggled to assert himself in the starting eleven amid tough competition, while Khedira – a World Cup winner with Germany – has been linked with a move away from the Bernabéu, with his contract set to expire this summer.\n\nThere is no denying the statement of intent behind Real Madrid's acquisition of Lucas Silva. The club has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to nurturing and developing the brightest young talents in world football, providing them with an opportunity to compete for silverware at the highest level. As the reigning European champions, Real Madrid is certainly an attractive proposition for any budding superstar, and Silva will have the chance to test his mettle alongside some of the most celebrated names in the game.\n\nAs the young Brazilian begins his journey in Madrid, fans and pundits alike will be keeping a watchful eye on his progress, eager to see if he can live up to the lofty expectations set for him. The stage is set for Lucas Silva to prove his worth and make a real impact as part of a world-class team. It remains to be seen how he will adapt to life in La Liga, and if he can become the lynchpin in central midfield that Real Madrid have been seeking.\n\nIn conclusion, the signing of Lucas Silva represents a fresh injection of youth and talent into the Real Madrid squad. With Silva expected to become an essential component of the squad, the future certainly looks bright for both the player and the club. It will be fascinating to see how Silva's potential translates into performances on the pitch and whether he can replicate the stellar displays that earned him a big-money move in the first place.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_4092", "prompt": "Question: Where is an important stopover location?\nAnswer: For some species of waders, migration success depends on the availability of certain key food resources at stopover points along the migration route.\n Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?", "response": "Answer: An important stopover location for migratory birds, particularly for waders, is the Yellow Sea, situated between mainland China, the Korean Peninsula, and the Eastern China Sea. This crucial stopover area serves as a resting and refueling point for numerous bird species during their long migrations to and from breeding and wintering grounds, connecting the Arctic breeding grounds in Russia and Alaska to the wintering areas in Southeast Asia and Australia.\n\nThe Yellow Sea's vast tidal flats and coastal wetlands provide a rich biodiversity of habitats, including mudflats, salt marshes, and seagrass beds, which support a diverse range of invertebrates and small fish. These abundant food resources are vital for the survival of millions of migratory birds that congregate here to rest, molt, and feed in preparation for the next leg of their arduous journeys. Some bird species, like the Red Knot, travel more than 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles) in a single migration, dramatically highlighting the importance of such stopover locations.\n\nAs one of the most significant stopover regions globally, the Yellow Sea is home to millions of birds across 600 distinct migratory bird species, including endangered species like the Spoon-billed Sandpiper, the Great Knot, and the Siberian Crane. During peak migration seasons, this area harbors an extraordinary number of spirited migratory birds that transform the landscape into a lively and bustling scene.\n\nUnfortunately, the Yellow Sea is facing severe conservation challenges due to rapid economic development and urbanization. Land reclamation activities, particularly in China and South Korea, have led to significant losses of important tidal habitat – essential for the survival of these migratory birds. The shrinking ecosystem not only affects the birds but also has serious implications for the overall health of the global environment.\n\nEfforts to conserve and protect this vital stopover location are underway. The East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership, a network of governments, international NGOs, and site managers, seeks to cooperate in conserving migratory waterbird populations and their habitats, focusing on vital stopover points like the Yellow Sea. Furthermore, both China and South Korea have designated important wetlands in the Yellow Sea as nature reserves and Ramsar Sites, offering some level of legal protection and international recognition.\n\nIn summary, the Yellow Sea is an irreplaceable and crucial stopover location for migratory birds, especially waders, providing essential resources for their long journeys between breeding and wintering areas. Conserving and protecting this area is vital for preserving global biodiversity and ensuring the survival of the millions of birds that depend on these habitats.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_6450", "prompt": "Article: Washing the grease from your hair may seem like the best solution at first, but daily washing actually causes your hair to produce more grease. Your hair tries to make up for the natural oils you’re washing out each day, causing a cycle of increased grease. Wash your hair only 2 to 3 times per week maximum for the best results. Getting your hair wet without washing also causes natural oils to be stripped away and causes your hair to overcompensate in grease. To protect your hair from getting wet in the shower, secure it inside a shower cap. Hair that’s prone to grease doesn’t need more conditioning near the roots, it needs less. However, not conditioning your hair at all can cause your ends to get dry and damaged-looking. When you use conditioner after shampooing, apply it starting halfway down your hair and go all the way to your ends.  Be sure to always rinse conditioner thoroughly from your hair, or use a leave-in conditioner. On days that you’re not shampooing, you can get rid of style creases or cowlicks by rinsing the creased parts of your hair and applying conditioner there as well. Hot water opens the cuticle of your hair and strips more natural oils from your hair. Hot water also causes your pores, including the ones on your scalp, to produce more sebum, or thick oil. This thick oil will start traveling down your hair strands from your scalp as soon as you leave your hot shower. For the best results, keep your shower water as cool as you can, especially when rinsing shampoo and conditioner from your hair. Cool water closes the cuticle of your hair, which will help to keep moisture in. Using too much shampoo with each wash can lead to build-up and make your hair look heavy and greasy. When squirting shampoo into your hand to use, make sure you use no more than a large coin amount, like a quarter or two-pence piece. You may need more or less depending on the length and thickness of your hair. If you accidently squirt too much shampoo into your hand, remove some of it before starting to apply shampoo to your hair.\n\nWhat is a summary?", "response": "A summary is a shorter version of a longer text that includes the main points and important details, but is easier and quicker to read. So, for this article, a summary would be: Washing your hair every day can make it greasier, so wash it 2 to 3 times a week. Use a shower cap to keep it dry when not washing, and apply conditioner only to the lower half of your hair.

His grief was all the more searing because the victims were also his father and mother. The third fatality was his 14-year-old nephew.\n\n\"I know what those people are feeling right now,\" Wright said before his visit.\n\nOne marked difference between the two tragedies was that the Rev. Timothy Wright of the Grace Tabernacle Christian Center initially survived after a drunken driver drove into his car, killing his wife and grandson.\n\nThe elder Wright was paralyzed, and among those who reached out to offer comfort and counsel was the family of the late actor Christopher Reeve, who had been consigned to a wheelchair by a horse-riding accident.\n\n\"He used to be Superman,\" David Wright noted.\n\nThe son would not forget the super strength the Reeve family gave him and his family over the nine months before the elder Wright succumbed to his injures.\n\n\"To have somebody step forward who knows. ...\" David Wright said.\n\nAfter hearing of last week's tragedy at the Joy Fellowship Christian Assemblies, Wright resolved to bring them the comfort of somebody who knows.\n\n\"It brought back memories of my mom and my dad's accident,\" he said Monday.\n\nHe also would be going as his father's 32-year-old successor as pastor of their Brooklyn church. The Rev. David Wright was heartened to see news reports of a service at the Bronx church. The faithful there were still able to praise and even thank the Almighty.\n\n\"That's exactly what they need to do now,\" he said. \"That's the same thing that got us through.

That's the big question,\" he said. \"My mom and my dad, they never did any wrong to anybody.\"\n\nThe same is being said about Bishop Simon White and his wife, Zelda White, in the Bronx. The big question looms as large there as it did in Brooklyn.\n\nYet heartbreak and hardship are what gave rise to faith in the first place, what have kept it going even while presenting it with a perpetual challenge.\n\n\"If everything was peachy cream every day, there would be no need for faith,\" Wright said. \"When you go through hard times is when you need faith.\"\n\nWithout it, hard times just get even harder.\n\n\"If you lose your faith, it just destroys you in the inside,\" Wright said. \"As long as you keep your faith, you know you'll be okay.\"\n\nWright was traveling from his church to the Bronx to offer proof that faith can indeed prevail. His father's Grammy-nominated choir is about to release a new CD. The Grace Tabernacle itself is thriving. The older members are adjusting to having the son as a pastor after two decades with the father.\n\n\"It took a little bit of getting used to,\" Wright said. \"You actually watched your pastor grow up. People that used to baby-sit me, now I'm leading them spiritually.\"\n\nHe hoped his presence at Monday night's prayer meeting would bring the congregation hope.\n\n\"Just let them know there is somebody there that went through that,\" he said. \"If I got through it, then they can.\"\n\nWhen his turn came to speak, his words were as simple as his message.\n\n\"God never says 'Oops,'\" he told the packed church. \"God would not have allowed this to happen if we could not handle it.\"\n\nTitle:", "response": "United by Faith: Spiritual Leaders' Families Offer Comfort and Hope Amid Tragedy", "token_count": 512}

The claim stemmed from contentious allegations published by the newspaper back in August 2003. These accusations implicated Collins Stewart in severe market malpractice, ultimately causing severe financial and reputational ramifications for the City brokers.\n\nAs the legal battle ensued, the crux of the matter hinged on the editorial rights and responsibilities of the publishing entity and the protection of those accused of wrongdoing in said articles. In an era where such allegations can spread like wildfire and significantly damage a business's standing in the market, the stakes in this case were undeniably high.\n\nNotably, the outcome of this legal dispute had the potential to set a precedent for other publications and serve as a stark reminder of the critical importance of adhering to journalistic standards, as well as ensuring comprehensive fact-checking prior to publication. As the case unraveled, it became clear that the reputation and financial stability of both the Financial Times and Collins Stewart hung in the balance, depending on the court's ruling.\n\nUltimately, the Financial Times emerged victorious, securing their position and reaffirming the vital role of a free press in a democratic society. This landmark decision supports the right of the media to report on events and allegations that are in the public interest, as well as reemphasizes the need for objective, fair, and balanced reporting.\n\nNot only has this case had a lasting impact on Collins Stewart, the Financial Times, and their respective stakeholders, but it also carries broader implications for the future of media litigation and libel claims. As the world increasingly relies on digital platforms for consuming news, this case serves as a cautious reminder of the power wielded by those in media and the responsibility to exercise that power ethically and responsibly.\n\nAs the dust settles on this hard-fought legal battle, this historic victory for the Financial Times is a testament to the importance of upholding press freedom while simultaneously respecting the reputations and livelihoods of those involved in the reports. It is a vital reminder that, amidst the fast-paced world of modern journalism, accuracy, impartiality, and accountability remain crucial in fostering a responsible and credible media landscape.", "token_count": 512}

The movie's ensemble cast includes actors such as Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Thandie Newton, and Ryan Phillippe, among others. However, none of these actors or any supporting characters played a role named Vaughan in the film.\n\n\"Crash\" is a drama directed by Paul Haggis that explores racial and social tensions in Los Angeles. The interconnected stories and characters depict the challenges faced by people of different ethnicities and social backgrounds as they attempt to navigate a complex and diverse society.\n\nThe film received several awards and nominations, including the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2006, as well as the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay. While it received critical acclaim for its powerful storytelling and thought-provoking themes, some critics felt that \"Crash\" was overly didactic.\n\nUltimately, the decision to invest in a film proposal depends on many factors, including the script, the cast, the budget, and potential marketability. It's essential to conduct thorough research and obtain expert advice to make an informed decision. In this specific case, since the character of Vaughan is not present in the film, it might have been a different version of the screenplay or an entirely different project altogether. Therefore, it's crucial to verify the information and proposal details before considering an investment.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_6173", "prompt": "Article: To determine what your healthy goal weight should be, use the body mass index (BMI), which can be used to predict risk for chronic diseases. BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of the person's height in meters (m). Identify the weight you would like to be in kilograms and then divide that by your height in meters to see if it is healthy. You can also use a BMI calculator, such as the one on the NIH’s website: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm Increase or decrease that goal weight so that it fits within the BMI range considered healthy:  A BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight. A BMI of 18.5-24.9 is a normal or healthy weight. A BMI of 25-29.9 is considered overweight, while a BMI greater than 30 is considered obese. Along with finding a healthy weight, also realize what is realistic. If you are 100 lb away from your healthy body weight with only a month before summer, consider setting a smaller, more attainable goal. The more calories you cut back, the more weight you will lose; however, it is important that you do not eat less than your Basal Metabolic Rate, the amount of calories your body needs to function effectively when at rest. This number can be calculated using an online BMR calculator. In general, don't aim to lose more than one to two pounds per week. A loss of one to two pounds per week is a healthy rate at which to lose weight; any more than this could be too drastic a change and may signify that your body is not getting what it needs. To do this, try to eat 250 fewer calories per day and burn an extra 250 calories a day. This ratio will create enough of a calorie deficit that you should lose one pound per week. During the summertime, you are surrounded by opportunities to eat, whether it’s at a barbecue, pool party, ice cream party, or summer luau. However, if you want to lose weight over the summer, it's important that you cut back on the number of calories you eat. As a general rule, weight loss occurs when you burn more calories than you consume.  To help figure out how many calories you normally eat each day, track your food for a day by writing down the number of calories in everything you eat and drink. Calories are listed on the back of food labels. For foods that do not have labels, you can find information about the caloric value of certain foods online through the USDA Food Database.  Pay attention to the number of servings you eat and multiply this by the number of calories per serving. For example, if you ate 30 chips and a serving size is 15 chips, you need to multiply the number of calories by two since you ate two servings. Once you have figured out how many calories you normally eat, cut down this number by 500-1000 calories per day to lose weight. In this log, record what you eat and the type and duration of exercise you're doing every day. This is a simple yet very powerful tool to keep yourself accountable. The log will help you track your progress and see whether you are keeping to your healthy diet and exercise regimen.  This is a wonderful way to hold yourself accountable and stay on track. There are many apps for smart phones that have capabilities to track food intake, energy expenditure, water intake and more! Often, we tend to overlook the snacking we do between meals and instead think our diet is not working. Studies have shown that most people underestimate how much they eat by 25 percent.  In addition, many of us think we get more exercise and burn more calories than we do. Use the log to identify how many calories your exercise—whether it be a run on the treadmill or a spin on the bike—is burning. If you use cardio machines at a gym, the number of calories is usually digitally calculated and displayed. Make sure to put in your particulars, such as weight and age, to achieve an accurate count. There are also online charts that can help tell you how many calories a half hour or an hour of a given exercise burns. You might also discover useful information about your daily habits and a reality check about how many calories you actually consume and burn off through exercise. Once you know your habits and patterns better, you can begin to address problem behaviors that are hindering your progress. Find a partner—whether that be a spouse, friend, or family member—who wants to join you during outdoor activities, hit the gym with you, or join your healthy eating plan. Having social support will make it easier to lose weight because the other person will also keep you accountable and be a sounding board for any obstacles and struggles you face along the way. If you cannot find a friend or partner to help you with your weight loss journey, utilizing the services of a personal trainer or registered dietitian will keep you accountable and help you stay active and eat healthy. A trainer can also be a huge support system. Think outside of the box for your support system! Always consult your physician before beginning any type of weight loss and/or exercise program. You should also consult your physician throughout your weight loss program and keep him updated of any changes or symptoms you may be experiencing, such as constipation thanks to your new diet plan or lethargy due to not getting enough food. In addition, you should also talk to your doctor if you are eating well, tracking your calories and watching what you eat, exercising, and are still not losing weight. This could be indicative of a more serious underlying medical condition, such as a thyroid problem.\nWhat is a summary of what this article is about?", "response": "This article talks about finding a healthy weight goal using a measurement called BMI (Body Mass Index) and making realistic plans to lose weight. It suggests cutting down on how much food we eat and doing more exercises to help lose weight.

{"id": "example_5851", "prompt": "Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: Calculation of pivot and similar levels based on time zones", "response": "Calculation of Pivot and Similar Levels Based on Time Zones:\n\nPivot points, support, and resistance levels are popular trading tools used by traders to gauge the market's potential movements. These levels are often calculated based on various time zones to better understand the underlying momentum and sentiment across different trading sessions. Time zones play a crucial role in these calculations as they help in identifying the open, high, low, and close prices for each session. Here's a detailed explanation of how to calculate pivot and similar levels based on time zones.\n\n1. Identifying Time Zones: The first step is to determine the time zones that you want to use for your calculations. The most common time zones used by traders include the Sydney, Tokyo, London, and New York sessions. Each session has a distinct trading window, during which significant market moves and events take place. Therefore, it's essential to be aware of the trading hours for these sessions and convert them into your local time for accurate calculations.\n\n2. Collecting Data: After identifying the time zones, the next step is to gather the necessary data, including the open, high, low, and close prices for each trading session. This data can be extracted from various sources such as trading platforms, financial news websites, or market data providers.\n\n3. Calculating Pivot Points: Once you have the relevant data, you can calculate the pivot points (PP) for each session using the following formula:\n\nPivot Point (PP) = (High + Low + Close) / 3\n\nThis calculation will help you to identify the central pivot point, which serves as a consensus of value for the market and provides a reference point for other support and resistance levels.\n\n4. Calculating Support and Resistance Levels: To calculate support and resistance levels, you'll need to use the pivot point as a base. Support levels are calculated using the following formulas:\n\nSupport 1 (S1) = (2 * Pivot Point) - High\nSupport 2 (S2) = Pivot Point - (High - Low)\n\nResistance levels, on the other hand, are calculated using these formulas:\n\nResistance 1 (R1) = (2 * Pivot Point) - Low\nResistance 2 (R2) = Pivot Point + (High - Low)\n\n5. Analyzing the Results: Once you have calculated all the necessary levels, you can plot them on your trading chart to identify potential trading opportunities, reversals, or breakouts. These levels can help you make informed trading decisions, set potential entry and exit points, and manage your risk-reward ratio more effectively.\n\nIn summary, calculating pivot and similar levels based on time zones is an essential step in understanding market dynamics across different trading sessions. By identifying the most relevant time zones, collecting the necessary data, and following the proper calculations for pivot points and support and resistance levels, you can gain valuable insights that will improve your trading strategies and overall success in the market.", "token_count": 512}

Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content.\nProblem:This movie stars Jay Leno as a Detroit cop, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a Tokyo cop sent to Detroit to retrieve a stolen prototype of a car motor. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit hoping to sell it to a up and coming car company ran by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately for him the men who were supposed to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype. An angry Derek Jarryd tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras who led the men. But Madras(played by Chris Sarandon) has none of it and threatens Jarryd forcing him to continue their partnership. Meanwhile in the same junk yard where the Japanese man had been killed, a friend of Tony Costas was also killed by the same men. Tony's friend had been watching the junk yard.Tony sets out to find the killer against his superior's order. Tony is on robbery while obviously homicide should investigate the case. While Tony is investigating the crime he runs into the Japanese cop and mistakingly he arrests him. Eventually they end up working together on the case. They make an odd pair and there are some genuinely amusing parts as well as some ridiculous scenes such as Pat Morita jumping and kicking right through a the windshield of a moving car and kicking Madras in the head. But it ends up being an enjoyable buddy cop movie, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is no actor, but he is likable in the role and Pat Morita is good as well. Still, they make for one of the more unlikely buddy cop duos in an action film. If you liked buddy cop films, cheesy 80's movies or you want to see Jay Leno as an actor then I recommend this movie.\nSolution:", "response": "The task here involves an analysis of a movie review, categorizing it as either positive or negative based on the details provided within the review. \n\nLooking at the guidelines provided: \n\n1) Positive: If the details of the review are generally optimistic, praising the film or specific elements of the film, or recommend viewers to see the movie, it is categorized as positive.\n\n2) Negative: If the details of the review are generally negative, criticizing the film or specific elements of the film, or discourage viewers from seeing the movie, it is categorized as negative.\n\nFor this review, it mentions that the movie has \"genuinely amusing parts\" and \"ends up being an enjoyable buddy cop movie\". Additionally, the reviewer states that if you are a fan of buddy cop films, cheesy 80s movies, or are interested in seeing Jay Leno as an actor, then they would recommend the movie. Therefore, based on these details, it is clear the review is largely favorable of the movie. \n\nHence, we can categorize this review as a \"Positive\" review as it aligns with the guidelines provided for positive movie reviews. It's important to note that a positive review can still contain some criticism, as long as the overall tone commends the film.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process\nAnswer:", "response": "The supposed perturbation in the given scenario can be classified as directly impacting a step of the process. To elaborate further, let's take a closer look at each step of the fossilization process and how a drought would affect it:\n\n1. An organism dies: The drought would not directly impact this step, as it does not have a direct influence on the death of the organism. The organism may die from various reasons, such as predation, disease or old age.\n\n2. Water seeps into the remains: This is the step that would be directly impacted by a drought. Due to the lack of water during a drought, the water seepage into the organism's remains would be significantly reduced. The limited water availability would make it more difficult for the necessary minerals to make their way into the remains, which is an essential part of the fossilization process. Therefore, the drought directly affects this step by reducing the water seepage.\n\n3. Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals: As the water seepage is directly affected by the drought, this step would also be impacted, but in an indirect manner. Since less water seeps into the remains, the chances of minerals dissolving in the water are lower, leading to fewer crystal formations.\n\n4. Crystallized minerals cause the remains to harden: This step is also indirectly affected, as fewer crystals are formed due to the reduced mineral dissolution in the previous step. Consequently, the remains would not fully harden, and the fossilization process would be less successful.\n\n5. The minerals form a fossil: Ultimately, the formation of a fossil would be indirectly impacted, as the previous steps in the process have been negatively affected. The reduced water seepage, along with the limited crystals and hardening of the remains, would hinder the success of a complete fossil.\n\nIn summary, the drought can be classified as a perturbation that directly impacts the water seepage step of the fossilization process. This direct impact on water seepage subsequently has a cascading effect, indirectly influencing the subsequent steps, ultimately affecting the successful formation of a fossil.", "token_count": 512}

The Pope met privately with Kim Davis and her husband, Joe, at the Vatican Embassy in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, September 24, which was the birthday of Kim’s father. Pope Francis spoke with Kim and Joe Davis in English. \n  \n During the meeting Pope Francis said, \"Thank you for your courage.\" Pope Francis also told Kim Davis, \"Stay strong. He held out his hands and asked Kim to pray for him. Kim held his hands and said, \"I will. Please pray for me,\" and the Pope said he would. The two embraced. The Pontiff presented Kim and Joe Davis each with a Rosary that he personally blessed. Kim's mother and father are Catholic, and Kim and Joe will present the Rosaries to her parents. Kim's mother was the elected Clerk of Court for Rowan County for 37 years until her retirement in 2014. \n  \n Kim Davis said, \"I was humbled to meet Pope Francis. Of all people, why me?\" Davis continued, \"I never thought I would meet the Pope. Who am I to have this rare opportunity? I am just a County Clerk who loves Jesus and desires with all my heart to serve him.\" Kim said, \"Pope Francis was kind, genuinely caring, and very personable. He even asked me to pray for him. Pope Francis thanked me for my courage and told me to 'stay strong.'\" \n  \n \"The challenges we face in America regarding the sanctity of human life, marriage, and religious freedom are the same universal challenges Christians face around the world. Religious freedom is a human right that comes from God. These values are shared in common by people of faith, and the threats to religious freedom are universal. Kim Davis has become a symbol of this worldwide conflict between Christian faith and recent cultural challenges regarding marriage,\" said Mat Staver, Founder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel. \n  \n Speaking with reporters on board the Papal plane to Rome, Pope Francis told Terry Moran of ABC News that conscientious objection is a human right, even for government officials: \"Conscientious objection is a right that is a part of every human right. It is a right. And if a person does not allow others to be a conscientious objector, he denies a right. Conscientious objection must enter into every juridical structure because it is a right, a human right. Otherwise we would end up in a situation where we select what is a right, saying 'this right that has merit, this one does not.' It (conscientious objection) is a human right. It always moved me when I read, and I read it many times, when I read the \"Chanson de Roland\" when the people were all in line and before them was the baptismal font and they had to choose between the baptismal font or the sword. They had to choose. They weren't permitted conscientious objection. It is a right and if we want to make peace we have to respect all rights.\" \n  \n The ABC News Chief Foreign Correspondent asked if that includes government officials as well, and the Pope reiterated that conscientious objection is a human right: \"It is a human right and if a government official is a human person, he has that right,\" Pope Francis affirmed. \n  \n After the above statement of Pope Francis was published, some in the media wondered if the Pontiff knew of Kim Davis. \"Not only did Pope Francis know of Kim Davis, he personally met with her to express his support,\" concluded Staver. \n  \n Liberty Counsel is an international nonprofit, litigation, education, and policy organization dedicated to advancing religious freedom, the sanctity of life, and the family since 1989, by providing pro bono assistance and representation on these and related topics. \n  \n ### |||||\nStudent:", "response": "Kim Davis, a county clerk in Kentucky, gained national attention for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, citing her religious beliefs.

Sunlight shines on plants: Photosynthesis begins with the absorption of light energy by chlorophyll pigments within the chloroplasts of plant cells. Sunlight is the primary source of energy for this process.\n\n2. Cells with chlorophyll capture the light energy: Chlorophyll pigments trap the light energy and convert it into chemical energy within the plants' cells.\n\n3. Plants absorb carbon dioxide through their stomata: Stomata are tiny openings on the surface of plant leaves that facilitate gas exchange. Plants take in carbon dioxide from the surrounding atmosphere through these stomatal pores.\n\n4. Plants absorb water through their roots and other parts: Water is taken up by the roots and transported through the vascular tissues, called xylem, to the different parts of the plant to maintain overall plant hydration and support various cellular processes.\n\n5. Plants absorb minerals through their roots: Along with water, minerals and nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium are absorbed by plants through their roots from the soil. These nutrients are vital for various physiological processes within plants, including photosynthesis.\n\n6. Plants convert these inputs into sugars: Once all the required inputs are absorbed by the plant, the process of photosynthesis commences. The chemical energy captured by chlorophyll, along with water, carbon dioxide, and minerals, is used to produce glucose (sugar) molecules through a series of complex chemical reactions. The glucose molecules serve as a primary energy source for plants, allowing them to grow, develop, and reproduce.\n\n7. Sugars can be used as energy sources: The glucose produced through photosynthesis is either utilized immediately to fuel various metabolic processes within the plant or converted into complex carbohydrates (such as starch and cellulose) and stored for later use.\n\n8. Oxygen and water are produced: As the final step of the process, oxygen and water are released as by-products of photosynthesis. The oxygen produced during photosynthesis is released through the same stomata used to absorb carbon dioxide, ultimately benefiting the entire ecosystem by providing a vital oxygen source for a plethora of life forms, including humans and other animals.\n\nThus, the final step involves the release of oxygen and water as by-products of the photosynthesis process, which not only completes the process but also plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance on our planet.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_957", "prompt": "A Slew of Staph Infections Tackles the NFL\nThe NFL is learning the hard way that a microscopic foe can be much more imposing than a 300-pound lineman, as a sudden slew of staph infections has sacked several players in the game.\n\nEarly this week, Cleveland Browns tight end Kellen Winslow Jr. revealed that staph (short for Staphylococcus) infection had sent him to the Cleveland Clinic for three days, and he accused the Browns of asking him to cover it up. Pro football teams are notoriously reluctant to reveal any information on player injuries, but since six different Browns have caught the bug since 2005  Winslow has had it twice  the team's medical management looked suspect to some observers. \"There's obviously a problem [with staph] and we have to fix it,\" Winslow told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. \"Just look at the history around here. It's unfortunate, because it happens time and time again.\" The Browns, who denied that they had kept the news of his infection from his teammates, suspended Winslow one game for his rant, which included his claim that he felt like he had been treated like \"a piece of meat.\"\n\nBut the Winslow medical controversy wasn't even the worst of it for the league. In the past week, it has become clear that two of its most marketable stars, marquee quarterbacks Tom Brady and Peyton Manning, had gotten infections. The New England Patriots' Brady has had at least two additional infection-related procedures since his initial season-ending knee surgery in September. It's now possible that his knee will have to undergo another operation, which could delay his return until 2010. Staph seems to be the likely culprit, but neither Brady nor the Patriots will confirm that. During training camp staph infected a bursa sac, which acts as a cushion between bones, in Manning's left knee. The infection required surgery and forced him to miss most of the preseason. Though the Colts released a statement on Friday insisting Manning didn't contract a more perilous staph, the anti-biotic resistant strain known as MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), the incidents should alarm the NFL. \"The NFL, and all the leagues, should be diligent, and not let their guards down,\" says Dr. Robert Gotlin, director of Orthopedic and Sports Rehabilitation at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. \"They've got to do better. It's got to be one of the top five priorities.\"\n\nThe recent cases have certainly gotten players' attention. \"I'm concerned, and wondering why it's happening. It's not some little infection that goes away in a few days, it's pretty serious,\" says Chicago Bears rookie running back Matt Forte. The league is quick to point out that it has partnered with teams to educate players about the bacteria, while the players' union insists it's alarmed and has contacted the league about further action. Some teams, like the Colts, have posted pictures on training room walls that warn players about staph symptoms and how to avoid contracting or spreading it. For their part, the Browns note that the team has previously used a special anti-staph agent to disinfect the locker room, weight room and other places where players gather.\n\nStaph, of course, is far from just an NFL problem. Two college teams, the '05 Florida Gators and the '03 USC Trojans, had multiple cases. And football is by no means the only sports victim. The infection kept Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Alex Rios out of the 2006 All-Star Game. A few days later another Toronto player caught it, and the clubhouse was disinfected. NBA players Paul Pierce, Grant Hill and Drew Gooden have had it. Staph killed a high school wrestler in California this summer, and last spring 15 students at a Pennsylvania high school were either treated for staph or symptoms caused by the virus.\n\nWhat exactly are staph infections? Staph is bacteria carried on the skin, which can enter the body through a cut or during a medical procedure, causing the infection. Most are minor, but certain strains are particularly resistant to anti-biotics and can cause athletes to miss significant playing time. Athletes are more likely to suffer cuts, and the locker room setting bunches players close to one another in a warm, damp environment, so they are especially susceptible to spreading the bacteria. Since football teams carry some 55 players on their rosters, and tend to have a higher degree of serious injuries to deal with, they are at particular risk. According to a 2005 survey by the NFL Team Physicians Society, 13 out of 30 teams that responded had had a player contract MRSA in recent years, for a total of 60 leaguewide infections.\n\nThough Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Omar Gaither rightly points out that \"we're just a naturally dirty sport,\" there are several basic precautions athletes can take to lower the chance of catching an infection. Many athletes shave their ankles, legs, and arms because they don't want athletic tape ripping hair off their bodies, but experts say they should lose the razor. \"No matter how careful the shaving is, you can have nicks and microscopic cuts in the skin,\" says Dr. Daniel Sexton, an infectious disease specialist at the Duke University Medical Center, who consults for an NFL team and several college programs. \"Any time you break that barrier, it becomes a portal through which bacteria can gain access.\" Staph prevention is pretty low-tech. \"You know, this is pretty simple,\" Sexton says. \"Hand washing remains the primary defense against the transmissions of most organisms, including staph. Most people don't think of a locker room as a place where hand hygiene is important, but locker rooms are also mini-emergency rooms.\"\n\nIn 2003, a team of researchers tracked the St. Louis Rams and found five players who caught eight MRSA infections. \"We observed a lack of regular access to hand hygiene (i.e., soap and water or alcohol-based hand gels) for trainers who provided wound care,\" they wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine. Other offenses included \"skipping of showers by players before the use of communal whirlpools; and sharing or towels  all factors that might facilitate the transmission of infection in this setting.\"\n\nIn short: use a little common sense, tough guys. But when it comes to infectious germs, even a 245-lb. bruiser like Gaither believes you can't always outrun them. \"You can't worry about it to death,\" he says. \"It's not like you can walk around and put gloves on your hand every 10 seconds. Sometimes, there's just not that much you can do.\" Except hope that these recent cases are a coincidental hiccup, and not an epidemic that seriously tackles the NFL.\n\n(See pictures of the week here.)\nWhat was this article about?", "response": "This article discusses the issue of staph infections becoming a growing concern in the NFL.

This situation may have arisen due to several contributing factors, each amplifying the auditory chaos that enveloped the vicinity of his residence.\n\nFirstly, the neighborhood itself might be closely packed with houses and apartments, fostering a condensed living arrangement where the walls and barriers provide minimal insulation against the sounds produced by the inhabitants. As a consequence, mundane domestic activities like conversing, playing music, or utilizing appliances would reverberate throughout the locale, generating an incessant background noise that could easily overwhelm James's television audio.\n\nMoreover, it is highly plausible that large numbers of pedestrians and street traffic contribute to the heightened noise levels in the area. The constant hustle and bustle of people going about their daily lives, running errands, or engaging in conversations could lead to a cacophony of voices and footsteps. Additionally, a busy street with a steady flow of cars, buses, motorcycles, and other vehicles adds another layer of disturbance to the audioscape. The emissions arising from engines, honks, brakes, and steady whooshes of passing automobiles exacerbate the noise pollution affecting James's ability to hear his television clearly.\n\nBeyond the immediate residential and street scenarios, James's neighborhood could also be exposed to intrusive noise influxes originating from commercial establishments and ongoing construction work. Restaurants and pubs, usually found in populated areas, might host patrons who partake in lively discussions or even boisterous revelry, generating substantial noise spillage. Similarly, live music venues, nightclubs, or other entertainment options contribute significantly to the din pervading the surroundings. Meanwhile, ongoing construction projects in the vicinity – be it new developments, renovations, or infrastructure improvements – generate hammering, drilling, and machinery noises that could further impede James's efforts to hear his television.\n\nLastly, James's neighborhood might be located near prominent noise sources, such as railroads, airports, or busy highways. The relentless stream of noise generated by trains, planes, or incessant road traffic would ultimately deprive the area of any semblance of peace and quiet. Consequently, the compounded acoustic chaos radiating from these disparate sources would obliterate the possibility of making out the television's audio output amidst the prevailing noise pollution.\n\nIn conclusion, James's struggle to hear his television in his neighborhood arises from a range of factors that culminate in an inescapable cacophony. To address this issue, he might consider investing in noise-canceling headphones, soundproofing his residence, or opting for alternate entertainment methods like streaming services with subtitles, which can potentially alleviate the frustration caused by his audibility predicament.", "token_count": 512}

Pierre Haski reports at Rue 89: \n  \n Sunday, Palm Sunday in Catholic tradition, the protesters were more aggressive: two people managed to get into the museum and to strike at art works with hammers that they concealed in their clothing. No one was arrested at the time, but, according to the director of the museum, who was interviewed on France Culture [a radio station], two people had already been identified from photos taken at Saturday’s protest and are being sought by the police. \n  \n One of the works they destroyed was Andres Serrano’s 1987 photograph “Piss Christ,” which, Haski writes, was “displayed two years ago at the Pompidou Center without making waves.” But, of course, Paris isn’t Avignon—the seat of the papacy in the fourteenth century. The organization behind the protest, Civitas (“for a Catholic city”), expressly seeks “the restoration of the social reign of Jesus Christ over civil society.” \n  \n In 1989, Serrano’s photograph became an object of national controversy here when it was shown in an exhibit in North Carolina. At the time, I was working as an editorial factotum to Edward de Grazia, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law, as he was completing his magisterial book about the recent history of censorship (mainly) in the United States, “Girls Lean Back Everywhere.” He discusses the controversy in the book. Serrano and his work were denounced on the floor of Congress by New York’s Senator Alfonse D’Amato and by North Carolina’s Senator Jesse Helms (“I do not know Mr. Andres Serrano, and I hope I never meet him because he is not an artist, he is a jerk”). It resulted in funding cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts, which had partially financed the show in which the photo was included—as well as in a bill to prevent the N.E.A. from funding art works that “denigrate the objects or beliefs of the adherents of a particular religion or nonreligion.” But the photograph wasn’t destroyed. \n  \n I’m reminded of the difference between screenings of Jean-Luc Godard’s “Hail Mary” in France in January, 1985 (advance screenings there were interrupted by protesters who threw stink bombs, and a reel of the film was stolen from a projection booth), and its screening here at the New York Film Festival later that year (protesters arrived by the busload and blocked the streets in front of Alice Tully Hall, but the police cordoned off a corridor to allow ticket-holders to pass, and the screening took place unimpeded). In 1988, movie theatres in France showing Martin Scorsese’s film “The Last Temptation of Christ” were vandalized—including by Molotov cocktail and tear gas—and spectators were assaulted by Catholic fundamentalists. ||||| Image caption There had been protests against the work the day before the attack \n  \n A controversial photograph of a crucifix bathed in urine has been vandalised at an art museum in southern France, officials said. \n  \n The work, Piss Christ, by American artist Andres Serrano, was attacked on Sunday by three vandals who also threatened staff at the museum in Avignon. \n  \n A demonstration against the photograph drew some 800 protesters on Saturday. \n  \n The work also proved contentious in the US when it was first displayed in 1989. \n  \n Protests \n  \n Police said two people had attempted to enter the Collection Lambert art museum on Sunday morning with paint spray and a chisel in their jackets. \n  \n As a guard was removing the items, a third person took a hammer to the work, according the Associated Press. \n  \n The museum said in a statement the vandals physically threatened three guards before fleeing. \n  \n A second work, The Church, the torso of a nun with her hands in her lap, was also damaged. \n  \n On Saturday, a right-wing group held a protest to denounce the photograph as blasphemous and to call for its removal. \n  \n One museum worker told Reuters news agency they had received death threats by phone. \n  \n \"We're nervous and we have asked for protection from the police,\" the employee said. \n  \n The museum said the exhibition, entitled I Believe In Miracles, would be open as usual on Tuesday with the damaged works on show. |||||\n\nSummary:", "response": "A controversial artwork, \"Piss Christ\" by American artist Andres Serrano, was destroyed during a protest by Catholic activists at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Avignon, France.

{"id": "example_11192", "prompt": "Stimuloitu emissio\n\nCould you please translate this to English?", "response": "\"Stimuloitu emissio\" is a Finnish term that translates to \"stimulated emission\" in English. \n\nStimulated emission is a quantum mechanical process in which a particle, such as an electron or an atom, is induced to emit radiation by external factors, such as the interaction with electromagnetic fields. This process is a significant aspect of lasers (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) and masers (Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) technologies.\n\nIn these devices, a population of particles is excited to a higher energy level through various methods, such as illumination with light or electrical pumping. When an incoming photon interacts with an excited particle (atom or molecule), the particle may be stimulated to emit an additional photon with the same energy (wavelength), phase, and direction as the incoming photon. This process of photon-induced emission is called stimulated emission. As more emitted photons interact with other excited particles, a chain reaction occurs, and the process continues, amplifying the intensity of light or electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe concept of stimulated emission was first proposed by Albert Einstein in 1917, but it wasn't until the 1950s and 1960s that it led to the development of masers and lasers. Lasers have diverse applications in various fields, including medicine, telecommunications, entertainment, military, and scientific research.\n\nIn summary, \"stimuloitu emissio\" translates to \"stimulated emission\" in English, a fundamental principle in the functioning of lasers and masers, which contribute significantly to technology and advancements in numerous fields.", "token_count": 356}

{"id": "example_99", "prompt": "What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?\nYou could go directly into the confessional (provided there's no one else in there or waiting outside), but sometimes it's nice to take a minute in the pew by yourself beforehand. You have this beautiful church probably almost all to yourself. Can you feel its energy resonating through you? Can you feel the majesty of the Lord's kingdom and how you're a part of it? Take a moment to kneel and pray with your head down and hands clasped together. Reflect on your faith and how you feel currently. Think about how you've been responding to God's call and how you've been living in the light of his love. When the priest is ready for you, of course. You'll probably see him there by his lonesome or someone else walk out just before you. Sit down either across from him or behind the screen -- it's totally up to you whether or not you prefer to remain anonymous. He won't treat you any differently either way. Make the sign of the cross upon his prompt, saying, \"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.  It has been (blank) since my last confession.\" This is your standard, traditional phrasing. However, if you just sit down and say hello, that's fine, too. The priest knows what he's doing. The Byzantine Rite is a bit different. The priest may sit to your side and put his epitrachelion on your head. He may then also do the Prayer of Absolution. But the idea remains the exact same -- just go wherever he takes you. Once you sit down and you've made the sign of the cross, just sit back and follow the priest's lead. He'll ask you how long it's been since your last confession (if you don't voluntarily offer that information), how you are feeling, maybe how your faith is going, and then ask you what sins you would like to talk about with him and God. It's just a casual conversation! Do not fret. There is absolutely zero pressure on your part. Again, as long as you come there with the intention of leaving with a clean heart, you're more than welcome in the church. There is no wrong way to go about confession! This part is intimidating, but think about it this way: the priest you're talking to has probably heard just about everything before. Whatever you have to say will not blow his mind. So when he asks, start rattling them off, from the most serious to the least. If he asks any questions, answer them, but do not feel the need to go into detail. A simple, \"I did so and so,\" will suffice. Your priest is going to be very understanding. If you don't remember the exact timeframe, that's fine. If you don't remember your motivation, that's fine. All your priest cares about is that you're being as honest as possible and that your heart is in the right place. He'll talk you through everything, possibly asking about your intentions, but mainly just letting you know that God loves you, sin and all. If he has any ideas to bring you closer to God, he may suggest them at this juncture. He's there to help, after all. He will then ask you to make an Act of Contrition. That goes like this:  My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,I have sinned against You whom I should loveabove all things. I firmly intend, with your help,to do penance, to sin no more, andto avoid whatever leads me to sin.Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.In his name, my God, have mercy  (If you are a Roman Catholic, your act of contrition will go like this: Oh my God, I am very sorry for having offended thee. I detest all of my sins because of thy just punishment. But most of all, because they offend you, my God, who is all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace, to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen. Don't worry! It won't be anything huge. You may even walk away just having to say a few meaningful prayers. Take the absolution to heart -- you now have a brand new, clean slate to work with. It'll feel so uplifting! Just to clarify, \"absolution\" means your sins are washed away. \"Penance\" is your expression of regret and repentance, showing God that you're truly sorry for what you've done and that you wish for nothing more than to be forgiven.\n\nSummary:", "response": "The article provides guidance on the process of confession in a church, emphasizing the importance of reflection, honest conversation with the priest, and the act of contrition for a meaningful and pressure-free experience, ultimately leading to absolution and spiritual growth.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_3022", "prompt": "Danielle Deaver, 34, wanted an abortion after doctors told her that her baby had no chance of surviving when her waters broke at 22 weeks. A new law in Nebraska which dictates that you cannot have an abortion after 20 weeks meant Deaver had no choice but to have her baby. With her husband, Robb, the couple waited ten days until she was able to give birth to baby Elizabeth. The couple cradled and comforted their baby for 15 minutes before she died.\n\nWrite an article based on these highlights.", "response": "Title: Heartbreaking Story of Woman Denied Abortion Under Nebraska's New Law\n\nSubtitle: Danielle Deaver Forced to Deliver Doomed Baby under Controversial Legislation\n\nIn a tragic case that has reignited the debate on abortion rights in the United States, 34-year-old Danielle Deaver was denied an abortion after her waters broke at just 22 weeks, forcing her to carry her baby to full term, who ultimately survived for only 15 minutes after being born. The reason behind this heart-wrenching decision was Nebraska's new 20-week abortion ban, which left Deaver with no choice but to endure the devastating outcome.\n\nThe doctors informed Danielle Deaver that her baby had no chance of survival after her amniotic sac ruptured at 22 weeks, leaving the fetus without the necessary protection and nourishing fluid to develop in the womb. In the past, medical professionals would have recommended an abortion in such cases, given the cruelty of making the mother and child suffer through an event that would ultimately culminate in the heartache of death. However, Nebraska's recent law change meant that Deaver's hands were tied, and she could not terminate her pregnancy after the 20-week mark.\n\nWith the support of her husband Robb, Deaver spent the next ten agonizing days waiting to deliver her child, knowing that there was no hope of survival. In an interview, Robb commented about how they knew their baby would not live, and they tried preparing themselves for the moment that would come. The couple's worst fears were realized when Danielle gave birth to their baby girl, Elizabeth, who survived for a brief 15 minutes cuddled in her parents' arms before passing away.\n\nThis tragic story raises several pressing questions not just about Nebraska's abortion laws but also regarding reproductive rights in the United States as a whole. The 20-week ban enacted in Nebraska, known as the \"Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,\" has been challenged by many in the medical and legal fields who believe that it is fundamentally flawed.\n\nCritics argue that the law fails to take into account exceptional circumstances, such as those experienced by the Deaver family, which result in the prolonged suffering of both mother and baby. Furthermore, opinions on when a fetus can feel pain remain divided among experts, leading some to view the time limit as arbitrary.\n\nIn a country where debate rages over abortion accessibility and a woman's right to choose, Danielle Deaver's heartrending experience serves as a painful reminder of the consequences legislation can have on the lives of real people. As lawmakers continue to grapple with contentious issues surrounding reproductive rights, stories like this one put a human face on the impact that such regulations have on families and their personal journeys.\n\nOne cannot help but question if rigid laws should be the final arbiter in deeply complex and individual cases such as Deaver's. What remains certain, however, is that the ripples from this tragic case will continue to be felt in the ongoing debate surrounding reproductive rights and the ethical considerations of abortion laws in the United States.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_3683", "prompt": "Sentence: \"Mary loves him.\"\nWould a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?", "response": "A linguist would likely rate the sentence \"Mary loves him\" as acceptable linguistically, based on several linguistic principles and components. To provide a detailed explanation, let's breakdown the key linguistic aspects that contribute to the acceptability of this sentence.\n\n1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the rules that govern the structure of sentences in a language. In English, the typical word order follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) pattern. In the sentence \"Mary loves him,\" the subject (Mary) is followed by the verb (loves) and the object (him). This structure adheres to the SVO pattern, making the sentence syntactically acceptable.\n\n2. Grammar: Grammar encompasses the rules governing the construction of phrases, clauses, and sentences in a language. When examining the grammar of this sentence, we observe that the verb \"loves\" agrees with the subject \"Mary\" in both number (singular) and person (third person). The verb is also in the present tense, which is appropriate for describing an ongoing action or state. The pronoun \"him\" serves as the direct object, and it is used correctly to refer to a male person. Thus, the sentence is grammatically acceptable.\n\n3. Semantics: Semantics deals with the meanings of words, phrases, and sentences in a language. In this sentence, \"Mary\" is a proper noun and denotes a particular person. The verb \"loves\" carries a clear meaning, expressing a strong affection or emotional bond between the subject and object. The pronoun \"him\" is used to refer to a male person, and its meaning is context-dependent; it relies on the presence of an antecedent, which is not provided in this sentence. However, this is common in standalone sentences and does not make it unacceptable linguistically. The semantics of the sentence are therefore understandable and convey a clear message.\n\n4. Morphology: Morphology pertains to the study of the internal structure of words and how they are formed in a language. In this sentence, all the words are well-formed and appropriate for their respective roles. \"Mary\" is a proper noun, \"loves\" is formed by attaching the regular third-person singular suffix \"-s\" to the base form of the verb \"love,\" and \"him\" is the correct form of the masculine pronoun used in the object position. Consequently, the sentence is morphologically acceptable.\n\n5. Pragmatics: Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which context influences the interpretation of meaning in a language. Although the sentence \"Mary loves him\" does not provide the broader context, such as whom \"him\" refers to or why Mary loves him, the sentence remains functionally communicative. Pragmatically, it allows the interlocutor to infer some specific information (Mary's feelings) and introduce further questions or conversation points to seek clarification of the missing context.\n\nTaking into account these linguistic aspects, a linguist would generally rate the sentence \"Mary loves him\" as acceptable linguistically, as it adheres to the key principles of syntax, grammar, semantics, morphology, and basic pragmatic understanding.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_584", "prompt": "(CNN) -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure, under a law that takes effect September 1. The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said. \n\nQuestion: \"Why do critics feel the law is unnecessary?\"\n\nAnswer: \"Women who wane to get abortion will go to a different state\"\n\nIs this answer to the question correct?\nOPTIONS:\n(1). no\n(2). yes", "response": "(1). no\n\nThe answer mentioned is not correct because it does not address the reason why critics feel the law is unnecessary.

{"id": "example_1160", "prompt": "Why Quora has word limit for question and question descriptions?\nWhy is there a sign limit on Quora for questions?\n\nMulti-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?\nOptions are:\nI. no.\nII. yes.", "response": "Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information.\n\nQuora, a popular question and answer platform, has implemented a word limit for questions and question descriptions for several reasons. The following factors contribute to the rationale behind Quora's decision to enforce these restrictions:\n\n1. Clarity: Concise questions tend to be clearer and easier to understand. By imposing a word limit, Quora encourages users to focus on the essential components of their queries, ensuring that the questions posed are easy to read and comprehend. In turn, this facilitates more accurate responses from individuals who possess relevant knowledge or expertise in the subject matter.\n\n2. User Experience: Restricting the length of questions and descriptions on Quora significantly improves the platform's user experience. By presenting brief, succinct questions, users can quickly scan and identify the topics that interest them or those to which they can contribute valuable insights. This increases user engagement, participation, and satisfaction on the platform.\n\n3. Maintain Focused Conversations: Another critical aspect of implementing a word limit on Quora is the ability to maintain focused conversations around specific topics. By encouraging users to keep their questions concise and to the point, the platform minimizes the likelihood of numerous branching or unrelated discussions, which can often lead to confusion and dilute the value of the information exchange. As a result, Quora can better fulfill its role as an efficient knowledge-sharing platform.\n\n4. Demands on Attention: In today's fast-paced and information-saturated world, people often have limited attention spans. Long and verbose questions have the potential to lose a reader's interest, leading them to bypass the question or miss essential details. By setting a word limit on questions and descriptions, Quora ensures that its platform remains engaging and accessible to a diverse user base.\n\n5. Quality Control: A word limit encourages users to prioritize the quality of their questions over quantity. It discourages the use of excessive information or irrelevant details that could potentially derail a discussion or dilute the question's primary focus. This emphasis on quality helps ensure that Quora remains an effective platform for knowledge exchange.\n\nIn summary, the word limit for questions and question descriptions on Quora contributes significantly to the platform's functionality and user experience. Through these restrictions, Quora promotes concise, clear, and relevant questions that foster targeted and meaningful conversations among members of its community.", "token_count": 512}

For one, it can improve memory, as the brain continuously processes, stores, and recalls new vocabulary and grammar rules. It also enhances problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills, as individuals learn to navigate complex linguistic structures and comprehend different meanings depending on the context. Bilingualism also encourages mental flexibility, as it requires switching between two languages and adjusting to different linguistic frameworks.

French treats plural forms and pronouns differently so \"you\" becomes \"d'entre vous\" instead of simple \"vous\".\n\n2. \"about ordering online\" translates to \"à commander en ligne\". In French, the preposition \"about\" is translated to 'à' when referencing a particular subject or topic.\n\n3. \"is now available\" translates to \"est désormais disponible\". The phrase \"is now available\" changes to \"est désormais disponible\", shifting the 'now' to be more formal ('désormais') than the literal translation of 'now' ('maintenant') in French to sound more natural.\n\n4. \"as Furniturebox concept store\" it's translated to the natural phrase \"en tant que magasin concept Furniturebox\". The preposition 'as' translate to 'en tant que' in this context in French. The words 'Furniturebox', 'concept' and 'store' are all cognates and acceptable in French, particularly in the context of brand names and modern industry terminology.\n\nRemembering this steps you can ensure a correct translation from English to French.", "token_count": 390}

Urgent assistance required on the project deliverables\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you in the best of health and spirits. I'm writing to you because I'm in need of immediate help with our ongoing project, specifically pertaining to the upcoming deliverables that are due next week. Despite my best efforts to find solutions and exhaust all available resources, I've encountered a few challenges that have impeded my progress. I was hoping to get your valuable input and assistance to steer the project back on track.\n\nTo provide you with a background of the problem, I have been working on finalizing the design elements for our latest project. However, the tight deadline, coupled with a few unexpected complexities, has made it difficult for me to navigate through the process smoothly. I have already reached out to other team members for assistance, but I feel that your expertise in this area would be invaluable.\n\nHere are the specific issues that I am struggling with:\n\n1. Technical issue with the design software: Our primary design software has been malfunctioning over the last few days. The recurring system crashes disrupt my workflow, and I have lost work on multiple occasions. I have reported the issue to the IT department, but they are yet to find a permanent solution. Since you have had experience handling similar software issues in the past, I was hoping to get some insights that could help me overcome this obstacle.\n\n2. Integration with external suppliers: We have been collaborating with external suppliers to procure certain components for the project. However, communication delays and inconsistencies in the provided specifications have created additional challenges. Considering your experience in managing external partners, I would greatly appreciate your advice on how to improve this collaboration.\n\n3. Lack of sufficient resources: Given the demands of the project, I have found that the allocated resources are inadequate for the task at hand. Securing additional resources at such short notice might be challenging. If you could share your thoughts on potential alternative solutions, it would help me streamline my efforts and optimize the existing resources.\n\nYour assistance in resolving these issues is critical, as they are becoming major roadblocks that may jeopardize the project's deadline. I understand that your schedule is busy, but I assure you that any help you could provide would have a significant impact on getting the project back on track.\n\nIf you would prefer to discuss this matter in person or over a call, please let me know your availability, and I'll ensure to schedule a meeting at your convenience. Your timely response and guidance would be greatly appreciated, as I'm eager to find solutions and complete the project within the stipulated deadline.\n\nThank you very much for your attention, and I look forward to working with you to address these challenges.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Job Title]\n[Your Contact Information]", "token_count": 512}

The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season.

{"id": "example_8413", "prompt": "Charles Sanders Peirce (, like \"purse\"; September 10, 1839 - April 19, 1914) was an American philosopher, logician, mathematician, and scientist who is sometimes known as \"the father of pragmatism\". He was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for 30 years. Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, scientific methodology, and semiotics, and for his founding of pragmatism. An innovator in mathematics, statistics, philosophy, research methodology, and various sciences, Peirce considered himself, first and foremost, a logician.\n\nIn 1879, Peirce was appointed Lecturer in logic at Johns Hopkins University, which had strong departments in a number of areas that interested him, such as philosophy (Royce and Dewey completed their PhDs at Hopkins), psychology (taught by G. Stanley Hall and studied by Joseph Jastrow, who coauthored a landmark empirical study with Peirce), and mathematics (taught by J. J. Sylvester, who came to admire Peirce's work on mathematics and logic). His Studies in Logic by Members of the Johns Hopkins University (1883) contained works by himself and Allan Marquand, Christine Ladd, Benjamin Ives Gilman, and Oscar Howard Mitchell, several of whom were his graduate students. Peirce's nontenured position at Hopkins was the only academic appointment he ever held.  Brent documents something Peirce never suspected, namely that his efforts to obtain academic employment, grants, and scientific respectability were repeatedly frustrated by the covert opposition of a major Canadian-American scientist of the day, Simon Newcomb. Peirce's efforts may also have been hampered by what Brent characterizes as his difficult personality. Conversely, Keith Devlin believes that Peirce's work was too far ahead of his time to be appreciated by the academic establishment of the day and that this played a large role in his inability to obtain a tenured position.  Peirce's personal life undoubtedly worked against his professional success. After his first wife, Harriet Melusina Fay (\"Zina\"), left him in 1875, Peirce, while still legally married, became involved with Juliette, whose last name, given variously as Froissy and Pourtalai, and nationality (she spoke French) remains uncertain. When his divorce from Zina became final in 1883, he married Juliette. That year, Newcomb pointed out to a Johns Hopkins trustee that Peirce, while a Hopkins employee, had lived and traveled with a woman to whom he was not married; the ensuing scandal led to his dismissal in January 1884. Over the years Peirce sought academic employment at various universities without success. He had no children by either marriage.\n\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: when was the university founded?", "response": "The quote from the above article does not provide information on when the university was founded.", "token_count": 512}

Remember to use an oil-based fence that is safe for wood and exterior use and choose a day that is not very windy. Use horizontal strokes for horizontal panels and vertical strokes for vertical ones. Allow the primer to dry before proceeding. Drying times vary, so refer to the instructions on the can of primer for precise drying times. Keep your nozzle about six to eight inches away from the fence. Use a steady back and forth motion to spray your fence. For horizontal panels, move up and down. For verticals ones, move back and forth.  After spraying down one panel, go over your work at a perpendicular line of about 90 degrees. This leaves a crisscross pattern on your fence that eliminates streaks. Make sure not to make arcs at the ends of each stroke. This will spray paint in unwanted places. After your paint dries, examine your fence. Decide whether or not a second coat is necessary. If you chose a quality paint, you can probably get by with a single coat. However, if your paint is a little thin, add an extra coat after the first 1 dries. Check your paint's instructions to see how long it takes to dry. Most paints need to dry overnight.\nWhat is a summary of what this article is about?", "response": "The article provides a detailed guide on how to properly paint a fence using a sprayer. It emphasizes the importance of reading the instruction manual and selecting the right nozzle for the task. The article also suggests using an oil-based paint suitable for wood and exterior use and painting on a non-windy day. The correct painting technique is outlined, including how to make horizontal and vertical strokes depending on the panels, maintaining the right distance from the fence, and crossing strokes to eliminate streaks. Lastly, the drying time and the need for a second coat are discussed, with the recommendation to check paint instructions for specific drying times.", "token_count": 496}

{"id": "example_11061", "prompt": "Please answer the following question: Question: \"What would help the Ottomans reach their ultimate goal?\"  Context: \"The Ottoman economic mind was closely related to the basic concepts of state and society in the Middle East in which the ultimate goal of a state was consolidation and extension of the ruler's power, and the way to reach it was to get rich resources of revenues by making the productive classes prosperous. The ultimate aim was to increase the state revenues without damaging the prosperity of subjects to prevent the emergence of social disorder and to keep the traditional organization of the society intact.\"  Answer:\nA:", "response": "In order to help the Ottomans reach their ultimate goal of consolidating and extending the ruler's power, while maintaining the prosperity of the productive classes and preventing social disorder, several strategies and policies can be implemented:\n\n1. Efficient tax system: Developing and implementing a fair and efficient tax system would ensure that revenues can be increased without causing undue burden on the productive classes. This would encourage economic growth and provide the necessary resources for the state to expand its power.\n\n2. Promoting trade and commerce: Facilitating international and domestic trade through the establishment of trade routes, encouraging innovation, and reducing barriers to commerce would help increase the prosperity of the productive classes and state revenues. This could include ensuring the security and maintenance of trade routes, as well as fostering diplomatic relations with potential trading partners.\n\n3. Investment in infrastructure: The state needs to invest in the development and maintenance of infrastructure to support economic growth. This may include projects such as building roads, bridges, ports, and irrigation systems to facilitate trade and improve agricultural productivity. A well-developed infrastructure would enable the productive classes to flourish and contribute to the overall prosperity of the society.\n\n4. Education and skill development: Investing in the education and training of the population would enable the Ottomans to develop a skilled workforce capable of supporting economic growth and stability. This could be achieved through offering scholarships, establishing educational institutions, and promoting technical and vocational training programs.\n\n5. Supporting agricultural and industrial growth: Encouraging innovation and the adoption of modern agricultural and industrial practices would ensure the consistent growth of the productive classes, contributing to the stability and prosperity of the society. State support for new technologies and best practices would help improve productivity and output, further increasing revenues.\n\n6. Maintaining social order and stability: One of the key aspects of Ottoman society was its hierarchical structure. Maintaining this structure and ensuring social stability would involve balancing the interests of various social groups, resolving disputes fairly, and enforcing laws consistently. A stable and well-functioning society would be more conducive to economic growth and revenue generation.\n\n7. Effective administration and governance: To achieve the ultimate goal of consolidating and extending the ruler's power, the Ottomans need to have an effective and organized administration, which can manage state affairs and revenues efficiently. This would include the establishment of institutions, appointment of capable officials, and implementation of laws and regulations.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the Ottomans could achieve their ultimate goal of consolidating and extending the ruler's power while keeping the traditional organization of society intact and maintaining the prosperity and well-being of their subjects.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_2814", "prompt": "Here is an article:\n\nThe legendary Oxford interview  during which a university academic invites a prospective undergrad into her study, hands him a cup of tea and ruthlessly probes the limits of his intelligence  is often cited as the scariest part of applying to the university. But for some young hopefuls, the overflowing bookshelves and wood paneling in a typical professor's study are just as likely to throw them as any question about Rousseau's \"social contract.\" For students from the inner city, many of whom have grown up with concrete and fluorescent lights, it's easy to be overawed.\n\nThat's why, in one of the roughest parts of London, a public school recently built a little piece of Oxford  a replica don's room  in the hopes of boosting students' confidence when they go for an interview in the real thing. Two days a week, students from Brooke House Sixth Form College in Hackney, known as BSix, gather amid the room's leather-bound tomes, gilded picture frames and Chesterfield sofa to meet with an Oxford history tutor to prepare to apply to either Oxford or Cambridge (also known in Britain as Oxbridge).\n\n(MORE: Britain's Universities: Funding Excellence)\n\nBSix's students  among the poorest in the U.K.  will need all the help they can get. In wealthier parts of the country like Reading and Hammersmith, students in public schools are 50 times more likely to gain acceptance to Oxford or Cambridge than their counterparts in Hackney. They also face fierce competition from students armed with the best education money can buy: in 2010, Oxford offered 44% of its places to students from private schools, despite the fact that only 7% of British students attend them. The scales are weighted so heavily, in fact, that five British private schools sent more students to Oxford and Cambridge between 2007 and '09 than 2,000 public schools combined, according to the Sutton Trust, an educational charity in the U.K. And things don't appear to be changing quickly. In 2010-11, Britain's top 20 universities  known as the Russell Group  took proportionately fewer students from state-funded, public schools than the year before, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency.\n\nWhen it comes to race, the numbers are even more dire. A recent investigation by Parliament member David Lammy found that in 2009, only 27 black students were offered undergraduate places at all of Oxford's colleges combined. For the entire decade from 1999 to 2009, black students received 10 or fewer places at more than half of Oxford's undergraduate colleges. Merton College, which accepted 795 white students during that period, admitted just four black students. (The real tragedy, some would argue, is that in those 10 years, only 32 black students applied to the college.)\n\n(MORE: The Queen Addresses Parliament, but Can Parliament Address Inequality?)\n\nOxbridge admissions are a subject that Britain's class warriors regularly clash over. Yet even the most hardened elitists would not deny that, historically, Oxford and Cambridge have served as a stopover for cosseted dauphins on their ascent from Britain's best schools to its halls of power. Every university-educated Prime Minister save Gordon Brown has attended either Oxford or Cambridge, and the tradition shows no sign of changing. Prime Minister David Cameron and his deputy, Nick Clegg, both attended top private schools and then Oxbridge, as did almost 40% of their Cabinet. Labour leader Ed Miliband also attended Cambridge, though he did not attend a private secondary school. It's not just politicians. All but one of the judges sitting on the U.K.'s Supreme Court and 81% of the current senior judiciary in the country studied at one of the two storied universities. Of the leading British journalists who went to university, more than half were educated at Oxford or Cambridge, according to a 2007 study by the Sutton Trust.\n\n(VIDEO: TIME's Interview with David Cameron)\n\nThe cabinet's privileged pedigree hasn't prevented its leaders from trying to address the problem, however. Last month, the government announced a record £900 million ($1.46 billion) budget for outreach to disadvantaged students, a total that has grown by $162 million in the past three years. And in late February, the government made the controversial decision to appoint Les Ebdon, vice chancellor of the University of Bedfordshire, as director of the Office for Fair Access. Ebdon's suggestion that the government withhold some funding for universities that fail to admit more poor students sparked a middle-class firestorm. The Sunday Times of London splashed the headline \"Will This Man Stop Your Child Going to a Top University?\" across an unflattering picture of Ebdon superimposed over an idyllic Cambridge college. In the photo, Ebdon holds a sign reading, \"Please Keep Out  Unless from a Disadvantaged Group, as Approved by the Dept. Social Engineering.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Oxford, which would rather the government not fiddle with its admissions policies, has pursued its own reform agenda. The university now spends $4 million a year on student outreach, which includes school visits and teacher-training sessions aimed at encouraging poor and minority students to apply to the university. In 2010, Oxford also launched a summer school called UNIQ, which gives some 500 academically talented, state-school students a chance to experience studying at Oxford for a week. In addition, the university admissions office highly recommends to tutors that qualified students from poor areas be invited for interviews. And it has set of a target of increasing the number of undergrads from socioeconomically disadvantaged areas from 6.1% to 9% by 2016-17.\n\n(MORE: A Perfect Day ... in Oxford)\n\nStill, the university balks at the idea of admitting a student with lower grades just because of his or her socioeconomic background. \"If your education is based around one-on-one tutorials with leading academics, you've got to select people who are really bright and will respond to that sort of educational system,\" says Oxford press officer Julia Paolitto. British parents paying through the nose for private schooling to ensure their children's places at Oxbridge tend to agree. But even those working in inner-city public schools say putting too much weight on a student's background may not be a good idea. \"We don't want any concessions from anybody,\" says Ken Warman, principal of BSix. \"It's not a good message for our students. Would you be as confident if you were let in because of where you were from?\"\n\nOne thing everyone seems to agree on is the need for more bright disadvantaged students to apply. And in that area, there's a lot to do. According to the Sutton Trust, less than half of public-school teachers urge their most promising students to consider Oxford and Cambridge. \"There is an awful lot of mythology about what it is and isn't to become a student at Oxford,\" says Mike Nicholson, director of undergraduate admissions at Oxford. \"We now spend a lot of time challenging that mythology.\"\n\n(PHOTOS: Cambridge University's Annual May Balls)\n\nFor one student in Hackney, this has worked. In 2008, 16-year-old Allun Bokhari arrived at BSix having dropped out of his previous school, with no academic qualifications. At first glance, he hardly seemed like Oxbridge material. Yet his teachers quickly spotted that he was smart and began helping him preparing for the tests that Oxford requires. Two years later, Bokhari was accepted to study history and politics at Queen's College, Oxford. In 2011, BSix sent a student to Cambridge, bringing the school's Oxbridge total to two. Warman says it may not seem like many, but looks can be deceiving. \"For a college like ours, that's a big breakthrough.\"\n\nPHOTOS: TIME's Pictures of the Week.\n\nPHOTOS: Cartoons of the Week.\n\nWrite a title for it.", "response": "\"Addressing Socioeconomic Disparities in Oxbridge Admissions: Efforts to Bridge the Gap and Encourage Disadvantaged Students to Apply\"", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_1902", "prompt": "Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was a considerable influence on Handel in the three years that he spent in Hamburg? from the following article ?  Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig.  In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias.  Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\", before, it seems, \"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\".\nA:", "response": "The full name of the person who was a considerable influence on Handel in the three years that he spent in Hamburg is Reinhard Keiser.", "token_count": 512}

Other guests include a prominent New York art gallery owner, an Italian advice columnist and an English writer, Alex Parrish, who is dying of an unspecified disease. Lucy goes for a swim, and finds that Diana's daughter from a previous marriage, Miranda Fox, is also there with her boyfriend, entertainment lawyer Richard Reed. Miranda's brother, Christopher, is supposed to be there, but he is off on a road trip with the Italian son of a neighboring villa, Niccoló Donati. Lucy was particularly hoping to see Niccoló, whom she had met on a previous visit to the villa, four years earlier, and who was the first boy she'd ever kissed. Lucy and Niccoló had briefly exchanged letters after this first visit. One letter in particular Lucy had admired so much she memorized it. Lucy reveals to the gallerist that she is there to have her portrait made by Ian, who is a sculptor. She says it's really just an excuse for her father to send her to Italy, \"as a present.\" Smoking marijuana with Parrish, Lucy reveals that she is a virgin. When Parrish shares this information with the rest of the villa the next day, Lucy is furious and decides to cut her visit short. While she is on the telephone booking a flight to New York, however, Christopher and Niccoló return from their road trip, and Lucy is once again happy, although she is disappointed that Niccoló did not immediately recognize her.  answer the following question:  What's the first name of the person who wrote the letter that Sara's daughter memorized?\nA:", "response": "The first name of the person who wrote the letter that Sara's daughter Lucy memorized is Niccoló.", "token_count": 442}

Context: \"That's Glenn Miller,\" my father said. \"But it can't be.\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \"You know the tune, of course,\" he said. \"'King Porter Stomp.'\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\" \"So why can't it be Miller?\" I asked. \"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \"They sound drunk.\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44.

{"id": "example_11267", "prompt": "Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach.

Elaine is instructed by the Chicago control tower supervisor Steve McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) to activate the plane's autopilot a large blow-up doll named \"Otto\" which will get them to Chicago but will not be able to land the plane. Elaine realizes that Striker is their only chance, and he is convinced to fly the plane, though he still feels his trauma will prevent him from safely landing the plane.McCroskey, after hearing Striker's name on the radio, sends for Striker's former commander, Rex Kramer (Robert Stack) to help talk him down. As the plane nears Chicago, Striker neglects to check the oil temperature which damages one of the engines while a bad thunderstorm reduces visibility, making the landing even more difficult. Thanks to Kramer's endless stream of advice, Striker is able to overcome his fears and safely land the plane with only minor injuries to some passengers. Striker's courage rekindles Elaine's love for him, and the two share a kiss while Otto takes off in the evacuated plane after inflating a female autopilot doll.

{"id": "example_1327", "prompt": "Which is this about?\n\n FRANKFURT (Reuters) - More than a year after the German  city of Munich declared its landmark intention to abandon  Microsoft Windows in favor of upstart rival Linux, its  councillors are finally ready to go ahead with the plan.", "response": "This article is about a significant decision made by the city of Munich, Germany, to switch from Microsoft Windows to Linux operating systems in its city administration's computer systems. The news highlights the city's bold move to rely on open-source software and emphasizes the growing popularity of Linux as a potential competitor to Microsoft Windows.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the context of this choice. Microsoft Windows has long been the leading operating system for personal computers, businesses, and government organizations alike. Its user-friendly interface and compatibility with a wide array of hardware and software has made it the go-to choice for many. In recent years, however, concerns related to cost, security, and flexibility have prompted some organizations to explore alternatives.\n\nEnter Linux, an open-source operating system that has been slowly gaining traction for the better part of two decades. Unlike proprietary software such as Windows, Linux allows for greater customization and control over its source code, making it an appealing choice for those looking for more autonomy in managing their systems. This open-source model also cuts down on licensing fees and long-term maintenance costs, which can be significantly lower in comparison to what's typically required with Windows.\n\nMunich's landmark decision to abandon Windows in favor of Linux demonstrates the city's commitment to exploring cost-effective, secure, and flexible alternatives to conventional software solutions. Faced with mounting licensing fees and obsolescence issues with its existing Windows-based systems, the city sought a more sustainable solution and began considering the open-source Linux operating system.\n\nAfter a year of careful deliberation, Munich's councillors finally felt confident in their decision to move forward with the switch to Linux. This choice marks a notable victory for the open-source community and could potentially influence other organizations and cities to follow suit in reevaluating their reliance on proprietary software. \n\nThe transition from Microsoft Windows to Linux would involve the migration of the entire city administration's computer systems, including thousands of workstations, servers, and other related infrastructure. This process can be challenging and time-consuming, as it involves retraining employees, developing new workflows, and ensuring compatibility with existing applications and hardware. Despite these challenges, Munich's decision makers believe that the long-term benefits of switching to Linux outweigh the initial costs and potential setbacks.\n\nIn conclusion, the article discusses the city of Munich's significant decision to switch from Microsoft Windows to the Linux operating system for its administrative computer systems. This bold move highlights the growing popularity and viability of open-source software as a genuine alternative to proprietary solutions. It also underscores the potential for other organizations and governments to consider the adoption of Linux and other open-source options, leading to greater flexibility, security, and cost-efficiency in the long run.", "token_count": 512}

Jack scored 5 points more than Jon. Since Jon scored 3 points, we can calculate Jack's points as follows:\n   Jack's points = Jon's points + 5\n   Jack's points = 3 + 5\n   Jack's points = 8\n\n3. Tom scored 4 less than the points of Jon and Jack together. We need to first find the total points of Jon and Jack together:\n   Jon and Jack's points = Jon's points + Jack's points\n   Jon and Jack's points = 3 + 8\n   Jon and Jack's points = 11\n\n4. Now, we can calculate Tom's points as follows:\n   Tom's points = (Jon and Jack's points) - 4\n   Tom's points = 11 - 4\n   Tom's points = 7\n\n5. Finally, to find the total points scored by the three of them, we can add their individual points together:\n   Total points = Jon's points + Jack's points + Tom's points\n   Total points = 3 + 8 + 7\n   Total points = 18\n\nSo altogether, Jon, Jack, and Tom scored 18 points in the basketball game.", "token_count": 332}

Jim lives in Illinois where it rains much more regularly so he has more time to spend dealing with his farm animals instead of watering his plants. Both men intentionally purchased their farms next to lakes since they have always loved fishing during their free time. The brothers are currently planning a fishing trip together, but they are just debating which lake to travel to.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will Greg's lake have more or less carbon dioxide than Jim's?", "response": "Based on the provided information, it is impossible to conclusively determine whether Greg's lake will have more or less carbon dioxide than Jim's lake. Carbon dioxide levels in a body of water can be influenced by various factors, such as photosynthesis, respiration, and the exchange of gases with the atmosphere.\n\nHowever, there are certain factors we can consider based on the given information:\n\n1. Climate: Greg's farm is in Texas, which generally has a warmer climate compared to Jim's farm in Illinois. Warmer water holds less dissolved carbon dioxide compared to colder water. This might suggest that Greg's lake could have lower levels of dissolved carbon dioxide than Jim's lake.\n\n2. Rain: Jim's farm receives more regular rainfall compared to Greg's farm, which rarely sees rain. Rain can increase the amount of carbon dioxide in a lake through the dissolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the introduction of carbon dioxide from runoff. This factor might suggest that Jim's lake could have higher levels of carbon dioxide than Greg's lake.\n\n3. Watering crops: Greg spends much of his day watering his crops, and depending on where he sources the water, this may have an impact on the carbon dioxide levels in his lake. If he uses water from the lake, it might imply that the lake experiences more fluctuations in carbon dioxide levels due to human intervention.\n\n4. Farm activities: Jim spends more time dealing with farm animals, which may produce waste that could enter the lake and lead to increased decomposition and respiration, contributing to higher carbon dioxide levels. However, this is based on the assumption that his farming practices could impact the lake's water quality.\n\nDespite these considerations, we still cannot determine with certainty the comparative carbon dioxide levels in Greg's and Jim's lakes. To accurately compare the carbon dioxide levels, water samples would need to be collected and tested from both lakes.", "token_count": 512}
{"id": "example_635", "prompt": "Q: Q: Which reaction between alkyl halides and ammonia makes alkylamines?   A:\n\nPossible answers:\n *nitrogen catabolism;\n *conductive substitution reactions;\n *nucleophobic reactions;\n *nucleophilic substitution reactions;\nThe answer is:", "response": "nucleophilic substitution reactions.\n\nThe reaction between alkyl halides and ammonia to form alkylamines is known as nucleophilic substitution reactions. Alkyl halides (R-X) are organic compounds containing a halogen atom (X) bonded to an sp3 hybridized carbon atom. Ammonia (NH3) is a nucleophile, a species capable of donating a non-bonding pair of electrons to an electrophile in a chemical reaction.\n\nIn a nucleophilic substitution reaction, a nucleophile (ammonia in this case) reacts with an electrophile (the alkyl halide) and replaces the halogen atom in the organic compound. The overall reaction is characterized by the breaking of the carbon-halogen bond and the formation of a new carbon-nitrogen bond, resulting in the formation of an alkylamine.\n\nThe general reaction can be represented as:\n\nR-X + NH3 → R-NH2 + HX\n\nwhere R represents an alkyl group, X is a halogen atom (such as chlorine, bromine, or iodine), and HX is the hydrogen halide formed during the reaction.\n\nNucleophilic substitution reactions can be categorized into two main types: SN1 and SN2 mechanisms. The choice of the mechanism depends on factors such as the structure of the alkyl halide, the nucleophilicity of the nucleophile, and the reaction conditions.\n\nSN1 mechanism (substitution nucleophilic unimolecular) involves a two-step process. First, the carbon-halogen bond breaks, resulting in the formation of a carbocation intermediate and a halide ion. Next, the nucleophilic ammonia molecule reacts with the carbocation, producing the alkylamine. This type of mechanism is favored for substrates that can form stable carbocations, such as tertiary alkyl halides.\n\nSN2 mechanism (substitution nucleophilic bimolecular) is a single concerted step where the nucleophile attacks the carbon atom while the carbon-halogen bond is being broken. This results in the direct formation of the alkylamine. The reaction proceeds through a transition state where both the nucleophile and the leaving group are partially attached to the carbon atom. SN2 mechanism is favored for primary alkyl halides and strong nucleophiles, such as ammonia.\n\nIn summary, the formation of alkylamines from alkyl halides and ammonia occurs through nucleophilic substitution reactions, which can be SN1 or SN2 mechanisms depending on the structure of the alkyl halide and other reaction conditions. These reactions are essential in the synthesis of various amine-based functional groups and compounds, which have a wide range of applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science.", "token_count": 512}

In the years leading up to the album, the New York Dolls had developed a local fanbase by playing regularly in lower Manhattan after forming in 1971. However, most music producers and record companies were reluctant to work with them because of their vulgarity and onstage fashion; the group later appeared in exaggerated drag on the album cover for shock value. After signing a contract with Mercury, the New York Dolls recorded their first album at The Record Plant in New York City with producer Todd Rundgren, who was known for his sophisticated pop tastes and held a lukewarm opinion of the band. Despite stories of conflicts during the recording sessions, lead singer David Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain later said Rundgren successfully captured how the band sounded live. Their music on the album incorporated carefree rock and roll, Brill Building pop influences, and campy sensibilities, while Johansen's colloquial and ambiguous lyrics explored themes of urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance, and authenticity. New York Dolls was met with widespread critical acclaim but sold poorly and polarized listeners. The band proved difficult to market outside their native New York and developed a reputation for rock-star excesses while touring the United States in support of the album.

{"id": "example_12053", "prompt": "Ask a question about Comprehensive school.", "response": "What are the primary features and goals of a comprehensive school system?\n\nComprehensive schools are a type of educational institution that emerged as a response to the selective nature of traditional schools, especially in countries like the United Kingdom. Comprehensive schools aim to provide an inclusive and accessible education for all students, irrespective of their social background, abilities, or future aspirations. The primary features and goals of these schools can be understood in terms of the following aspects:\n\n1. Inclusivity: One of the core principles of comprehensive schools is to be inclusive and break down barriers between students from different social, economic, and educational backgrounds. This commitment to inclusivity and social cohesion is evident in their diverse student populations, which contributes to a shared learning environment that promotes understanding and cooperation between students of all backgrounds.\n\n2. Non-selective admission: Comprehensive schools follow a non-selective admission policy, meaning that they admit students based on their residential area rather than any particular academic or intellectual criteria. This is in contrast to selective educational institutions like grammar schools, which require passing entrance exams to be admitted. This ensures that every student has equal opportunity to access high-quality education, without being subject to entrance examinations or barriers.\n\n3. Broad Curriculum: Comprehensive schools are designed to cater to a wide range of skills, interests, and abilities among their student body. To achieve this, the schools offer a broad curriculum that includes a range of academic, vocational, and extracurricular subjects. This allows students to explore their strengths and interests and ensures that they have the flexibility to develop various skills, which is essential for personal and professional development.\n\n4. Mixed-ability teaching: A significant aspect of comprehensive schools is their approach to mixed-ability teaching. Students are not segregated based on their academic ability but are instead taught in the same classrooms. This helps prevent the development of a divide between high-achieving students and others and fosters an environment of support and collaboration.\n\n5. Personalized learning: Recognizing that students may have different learning needs, comprehensive schools strive to provide personalized learning experiences for their students. This includes providing targeted support and resources for those who require them, as well as ensuring that teaching methods and resources accommodate various learning styles and preferences.\n\n6. Career guidance and support: Comprehensive schools recognize the importance of preparing students for their future careers and provide a range of services to achieve this goal. This includes offering career guidance and counseling services, as well as connecting students with internship, volunteering, and job opportunities. Overall, comprehensive schools aim to equip their students with the knowledge, skills, and experience necessary to succeed in their chosen fields.\n\n7. Community integration: Comprehensive schools often act as community hubs, fostering connections between the school, parents, and the wider community. By organizing and participating in various community events, projects, and initiatives, comprehensive schools aim to promote a sense of belonging and shared responsibility among all stakeholders.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary features and goals of comprehensive schools center around promoting inclusivity, delivering a broad curriculum, fostering mixed-ability teaching, and providing personalized learning experiences, career guidance, and community integration. Through these features, comprehensive schools strive to offer a well-rounded and accessible education that caters to every student's unique needs and interests.", "token_count": 512}

Context: Additionally, genes can have regulatory regions many kilobases upstream or downstream of the open reading frame. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site.

{"id": "example_12064", "prompt": "Background: Rabindranath Tagore FRAS ( ( listen); Bengali: [robindronath thakur]), also written Ravindranatha Thakura (7 May 1861 - 7 August 1941), sobriquet Gurudev, was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of Gitanjali and its \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse\", he became in 1913 the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his \"elegant prose and magical poetry\" remain largely unknown outside Bengal.\nContext: Dutta and Robinson describe this phase of Tagore's life as being one of a \"peripatetic litterateur\". It affirmed his opinion that human divisions were shallow. During a May 1932 visit to a Bedouin encampment in the Iraqi desert, the tribal chief told him that \"Our prophet has said that a true Muslim is he by whose words and deeds not the least of his brother-men may ever come to any harm ...\" Tagore confided in his diary: \"I was startled into recognizing in his words the voice of essential humanity.\" To the end Tagore scrutinised orthodoxy--and in 1934, he struck. That year, an earthquake hit Bihar and killed thousands. Gandhi hailed it as seismic karma, as divine retribution avenging the oppression of Dalits. Tagore rebuked him for his seemingly ignominious implications. He mourned the perennial poverty of Calcutta and the socioeconomic decline of Bengal, and detailed these newly plebeian aesthetics in an unrhymed hundred-line poem whose technique of searing double-vision foreshadowed Satyajit Ray's film Apur Sansar. Fifteen new volumes appeared, among them prose-poem works Punashcha (1932), Shes Saptak (1935), and Patraput (1936). Experimentation continued in his prose-songs and dance-dramas-- Chitra (1914), Shyama (1939), and Chandalika (1938)-- and in his novels-- Dui Bon (1933), Malancha (1934), and Char Adhyay (1934).  Tagore's remit expanded to science in his last years, as hinted in Visva-Parichay, a 1937 collection of essays. His respect for scientific laws and his exploration of biology, physics, and astronomy informed his poetry, which exhibited extensive naturalism and verisimilitude. He wove the process of science, the narratives of scientists, into stories in Se (1937), Tin Sangi (1940), and Galpasalpa (1941). His last five years were marked by chronic pain and two long periods of illness. These began when Tagore lost consciousness in late 1937; he remained comatose and near death for a time. This was followed in late 1940 by a similar spell, from which he never recovered. Poetry from these valetudinary years is among his finest. A period of prolonged agony ended with Tagore's death on 7 August 1941, aged eighty; he was in an upstairs room of the Jorasanko mansion he was raised in. The date is still mourned. A. K. Sen, brother of the first chief election commissioner, received dictation from Tagore on 30 July 1941, a day prior to a scheduled operation: his last poem.  I'm lost in the middle of my birthday. I want my friends, their touch, with the earth's last love. I will take life's final offering, I will take the human's last blessing. Today my sack is empty.

{"id": "example_2922", "prompt": "Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who won the vote with 48.77% in 2019? , can you please find it?   Politically, Istanbul is seen as the most important administrative region in Turkey. Many politicians, including the President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, are of the view that a political party's performance in Istanbul is more significant than its general performance overall. This is due to the city's role as Turkey's financial centre, its large electorate and the fact that Erdoğan himself was elected Mayor of Istanbul in 1994. In the run-up to local elections in 2019, Erdoğan claimed 'if we fail in Istanbul, we will fail in Turkey'.Historically, Istanbul has voted for the winning party in general elections since 1995. Since 2002, the right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP) has won pluralities in every general election, with 41.74% of the vote in the most recent parliamentary election on 24 June 2018. Erdoğan, the AKP's presidential candidate, received exactly 50.0% of the vote in the presidential election held on the same day. Starting with Erdoğan in 1994, Istanbul has had a conservative mayor for 25 years, until 2019. The second largest party in Istanbul is the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP), which is also the country's main opposition. The left-wing pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) is the city's third largest political force due to a substantial number of Kurdish people migrating from south-eastern Turkey. More recently, Istanbul and many of Turkey's metropolitan cities are following a trend away from the government and their right-wing ideology. In 2013 and 2014, large-scale anti-AKP government protests began in İstanbul and spread throughout the nation.

The group supported the album with extensive touring.  \"Ballad of Dwight Fry\" was a dramatized set piece in the live show, featuring an actress dressed as a nurse who dragged Cooper offstage and brought him back on straitjacketed in time for the second verse's \"Sleepin' don't come very easy / In a strait white vest\".  At the song's climax, Cooper would break free of the straitjacket and hurl it into the audience.  The Love It to Death tour of 1971 featured an electric chair in the earliest staged executions of the singer.  These executions were to become an attraction of the band's shows, which became progressively more flamboyant; the shows in the Billion Dollar Babies tour of 1973 concluded with Cooper's execution by prop guillotine.  The Love It to Death tour grossed so much the band bought a forty-two room mansion from Ann-Margret in Greenwich, Connecticut, which was to be its home base for the next few years.The album garnered mixed reviews.  Billboard called the album \"artfully absurd third-generation rock\" and the group \"the first stars of future rock\".  John Mendelsohn gave the album a favorable review in Rolling Stone, writing that it \"represents at least a modest oasis in the desert of dreary blue-jeaned aloofness served up in concert by most American rock-and-rollers\". However, referring to \"Black Juju\" he also said that \"the one bummer on this album is so loud a bummer that it may threaten to neutralize the ingratiating effect\" of the other tracks.

Article: Rock stars and their money Around the world young people are spending unbelievable sums of money listening to rock music. Forbes reports that at least fifty rock stars have incomes between two million and six million dollars per year. \"It doesn't make sense,\" says Johnny Mathis, one of the older music millionaires, who made a million dollars a year when he was popular in 1950s. \"Performers aren't worth this kind of money. In fact, nobody is.\" But the rock stars' admirers seem to disagree. Those who love rock music spend about two billion dollars a year for records. They pay 150 million to see rock stars in person. Luck is a key word for explaining the success of many. In 1972 one of the luckiest was Kon Mclean, who wrote and sang \"American Pie\". Mclean writes his own music, so he earns an additional two cents on every single record of the song. Neil Young who performs in torn blue jeans, sometimes sings to an audience of 10,000, each of whom has paid five dollars for a ticket. After paying expenses, Young leaves with about $ 18,000 in his blue jeans at the end of an evening. How do the rock stars use their money? What do they do when the money starts pouring in like water? Most of the young stars simply show the money around. England's Elton John gave someone a $ 38,000 Rolls car and bought himself 5,000 pairs of eyeglasses, then lighted up and spelt :E-L-T-O-N. He also bought himself two cars, \"one for each foot\". Many rock stars live like Grace Slick and Jefferson Airplane. Those performers return from a tour, pay their bills, and buy new toys.

{"id": "example_1310", "prompt": "The weather phenomena this last month had an immense impact on Dirk county, the precipitation lead to many flood evens, the steady rain lead to massive water infiltration. 20 miles away, in Saulk county, they had a few thunderstorms, they had quite a bit of runoff, but less infiltration and less soil saturation.  Which county experienced more infiltration?  Hint: Precipitation can impact infiltration in many ways. The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur. If rainfall occurs at a rate faster than the infiltration capacity runoff will occur.", "response": "Given the information presented, it is clear that Dirk County experienced more infiltration due to the weather phenomena this past month. There are multiple factors that contributed to this conclusion, which include the amount, type, and duration of precipitation experienced in both counties.\n\nIn Dirk County, the weather phenomena consisted of immense precipitation, leading to many flood events. This steady rain, along with the massive water infiltration, has caused significant soil saturation. As more precipitation occurs, greater infiltration follows until the ground reaches its saturation point. The amount of precipitation in Dirk County, therefore, has resulted in increased infiltration.\n\nComparatively, Saulk County experienced a few thunderstorms. Although some runoff occurred, there was less infiltration and soil saturation in this region. The difference in the type of precipitation between the two counties played a vital role in infiltration. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than other types of precipitation such as snow or sleet. Therefore, Dirk County, receiving steady rainfall, experienced more infiltration than Saulk County, with only a few thunderstorms.\n\nLastly, the duration of rainfall also impacts infiltration capacity. As Dirk County had steady rain for an extended period, the initial rapid infiltration gradually slowed as the soil became more saturated. However, this prolonged rainfall contributed to the overall infiltration being higher in Dirk County since the precipitation event lasted for a longer duration.\n\nIn conclusion, Dirk County experienced higher infiltration due to the greater amount, steady nature, and extended duration of the precipitation events in comparison to Saulk County. The impact of these factors combined created higher soil saturation levels in Dirk County, leading to increased infiltration. Consequently, runoffs occurred at a lesser rate in Dirk County due to higher infiltration capacity, whereas, in Saulk County, despite fewer infiltration and saturation levels, runoffs occurred at a comparatively higher rate due to its lower infiltration capacity and shorter duration precipitation events.", "token_count": 512}

Bus station: While it is possible to meet a stranger at a bus station, there is no specific indication that the people there are responsible or have children. Bus stations are usually crowded and chaotic, making it difficult to determine someone's personal life. Additionally, this location is often associated with transportation rather than family-related activities.\n\n2. Paradise: This option is likely a figurative or abstract idea rather than a physical location. It does not offer any information about whether this location would attract responsible people with children. So, it is not an appropriate choice.\n\n3. Train station: Similar to a bus station, a train station is a place where people gather for transportation purposes. While strangers can be found at a train station, there is no way to determine whether they are responsible or have children, as these locations cater to various demographics and purposes.\n\n4. Park: A park is a public recreational area that is often associated with family activities. Parents with their children frequently visit parks to enjoy the outdoors, relax, and participate in activities like picnicking and playing sports. It is the most suitable option for meeting a stranger who is responsible and has children, as it is a place where families spend time together in a relaxed and secure environment.\n\n5. Sea: The sea, as a vast body of water, is not a specific enough location to search for a stranger. It also does not provide any context for meeting people who are responsible and have kids, as it is not a social gathering point like a park or a community event.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided options, the park is the most logical choice as it is a place where families gather for relaxation and leisure purposes.

{"id": "example_7302", "prompt": "Generate a context and a hypothesis.", "response": "Context: The impact of social media on mental health among teenagers.\n\nIn recent years, the widespread use of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat has vastly increased global connectivity and communication. As digital technology continues to evolve, social media has become an integral part of modern society, shaping the way people interact with each other. The use of social media is especially prevalent among teenagers and young adults, who are highly drawn towards these platforms due to their convenience and accessibility. However, concerns have emerged regarding the potential impact of social media use on the mental health of teenagers.\n\nHypothesis: Increased social media usage directly correlates to the worsening of mental health among teenagers.\n\nThe proposed hypothesis suggests that there is a direct correlation between the amount of time teenagers spend on social media and the decline in their mental health. This theory posits that the more time teenagers dedicate to these platforms, the more likely they are to suffer from mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to this hypothesis, including:\n\n1. Social Comparison: Social media platforms allow for a constant stream of comparison between users. Teenagers who spend large amounts of time on social media can become increasingly susceptible to comparing themselves to their peers, leading to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction with their own lives.\n\n2. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): The often-curated highlights of other users' lives on social media can create an illusion that others are constantly enjoying exciting events and experiences, leading teenagers to develop a fear of missing out (FOMO). This fear can contribute to increased feelings of anxiety and dissatisfaction with their own lives.\n\n3. Cyberbullying: Social media makes it easier for individuals to harass and bully others, and teenagers are particularly vulnerable to cyberbullying. The mental health consequences of being a victim of cyberbullying can result in depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts.\n\n4. Sleep Deprivation: Spending excessive time on social media, particularly at night, can lead to sleep deprivation in teenagers. Lack of sleep has been associated with a higher risk of developing mental health issues, including anxiety and depression.\n\n5. Addiction: Social media platforms are deliberately designed to be addictive in order to maximize user engagement. Dependency on social media may lead to increased feelings of anxiety, depression, and isolation for some users, particularly teenagers.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, researchers could design a longitudinal study that monitors teenagers' social media usage, mental health indicators, and other relevant factors over time. This would help establish whether there is a causal relationship between increased social media use and the worsening of mental health among teenagers, as well as provide valuable insights into the potential long-term impacts of social media on adolescent development and wellbeing.", "token_count": 512}

Reputed to be a grand master of kung fu, he enters a tavern where he is immediately attacked by the local ruffians. However, they are no match for his skill and even the legendary kung fu masters, the Furious Five, bow down to the panda's skill, requesting to hang out with him and fight alongside him as......Po the giant panda (Jack Black) wakes up from his dream in his room. His goose father, Mr. Ping (James Hong) calls to him from the noodle restaurant below to help serve tables. Po admires his Furious Five action figures before going downstairs. An extreme fan of Kung Fu, Po dreams of one day becoming a master worthy of fighting alongside the Five but his girth and clumsiness makes this dream simply a dream and his kung fu talents reside only within his knowledge of moves and artifacts. He is hesitant to express his desires to his dad who is more interested in running his restaurant and advertising his famous 'secret ingredient soup'.Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), a red panda who resides at the Jade Palace temple, practices kung fu in the courtyard with his students, the Furious Five; Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Mantis (Seth Rogen), before he is summoned to see tortoise Grand Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim). Fearing something is wrong, Shifu rushes to find him meditating in the grand hall. Oogway doesn't deny bad news but calmly tells Shifu he's predicted that the snow leopard warrior Tai Lung (Ian McShane) will escape prison and return to the Valley of Peace to wreak destruction once again. Intent on never letting this happen, Shifu sends his goose messenger, Zeng (Dan Fogler), to fly to Chor-Gom Prison to ensure that security is increased. Oogway then proclaims that it is time to choose the Dragon Warrior; a master of great skill who will be granted the secrets of the universe by reading the Dragon Scroll, kept delicately out of reach on the temple ceiling. Assuming that one of the Furious Five will be chosen, Shifu prepares a competition to determine which one will qualify.Flyers for the competition are spread throughout town and the villagers flock to the temple. Excited to have the opportunity to see his idols in person, Po follows with his noodle cart in tow but struggles on the long staircase to the temple. He is the last to arrive at the gates and finds that they've shut him out. In a desperate bid to see the competition before it's over, Po fashions fireworks to his cart and blasts himself high into the air, only to come crashing down in the arena just as Oogway is preparing to choose out of the Five. Po opens his eyes to see Oogway's finger pointed right at him and is shocked, along with everyone else, when he is proclaimed to be the Dragon Warrior. Oogway's decision is final, despite Shifu's protests, and Po is carried (unsuccessfully) into the temple leaving Tigress greatly disappointed since it seemed Oogway would have chosen her if Po hadn't arrived.Inside the temple, Po examines, with awe, the many weaponry and valuable artifacts before Shifu approaches him and berates him for his obvious lack of skill. He deflates Po's excitement by grabbing his finger in what Po recognizes as the Wuxi Finger Hold, reputed to be extremely powerful. Shifu promises that Po will regret ever being chosen before taking him to the Fives training room where Po is promptly put to the test. Nervous, but excited to try some kung fu moves, Po accepts the challenge but is hurtled, flung, and beaten down to a now-existing Level 0.On the way to the dormitories, Po overhears the Five poke fun at his incompetence.

At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation.

Explanation:", "response": "Shrinking is the correct answer to what is likely to happen to a snowman that is getting wet. This is because, as temperatures rise or sunlight directly hits the snowman, the snow begins to melt converting it into water. Since water takes up less space than snow, the snowman appears to reduce in size or \"shrink.\"\n\nA snowman will not \"cool off\" or \"get cold\" when exposed to warmer temperatures or sunlight, as these conditions will promote melting. Additionally, the snowman will not \"get larger,\" since melting reduces its volume and the structure's integrity.\n\nIn summary, shrinking is the most accurate description of what happens to a snowman when it gets wet due to warmer temperatures, sunlight, or a combination of both. This is because the process of melting causes the snow to convert into water, leading to a reduction in size.", "token_count": 233}

Additionally, their selection may not be as extensive as a typical store.\n\n- Liquid: This option does not make sense in the context of the question, as \"liquid\" refers to the state of matter rather than a location to purchase items.\n\n- Picnic cooler: A picnic cooler is not a location where you can buy items. It is an insulated container used to keep food and drinks cold during picnics or other outdoor activities.\n\n- Store: A store is a commercial establishment where a variety of items are sold, including canned soda and other goods. This is the most appropriate choice, as it allows you to purchase a can of soda along with other items you may need.\n\n- Vending machine: While a vending machine may have a convenient selection of soda cans, it is limited in terms of the range of other items available for purchase.

{"id": "example_6457", "prompt": "Fact 1: Athermal insulator slows the transfer of heat.  Fact 2: Heat is a measurement of transferable energy.  Given the two facts above, a thermal insulator slows the transfer of?\nAnswer:", "response": "A thermal insulator, given Fact 1 and Fact 2, slows the transfer of heat, which is essentially the transfer of thermal energy between objects or systems. \n\nTo understand the relationship between these two facts, it is important to have a solid grasp of the concepts of heat and thermal insulators. \n\nFact 1: A thermal insulator slows the transfer of heat\nThermal insulation refers to the process or materials that prevent or slow down the transfer of heat from one area to another. This can be achieved through several mechanisms:\n\n1. Conduction is the transfer of heat between objects in direct contact with each other. Insulators interrupt this process by minimizing contact between hot and cold objects or using materials with low thermal conductivity.\n\n2. Convection is the heat transfer via fluids (gas or liquid) that move and carry thermal energy between different locations. Insulators obstruct the fluid's motion, reducing convection and the resulting heat exchange.\n\n3. Radiation is the process of heat exchange through electromagnetic waves, primarily in the infrared spectrum. Insulating materials can absorb and reflect radiant heat to minimize its transfer between surfaces. \n\nFact 2: Heat is a measurement of transferable energy\nHeat can be defined as a form of energy that is transferred between systems or objects when they are at different temperatures. The transfer occurs from the higher temperature object to the lower temperature object until thermal equilibrium is achieved. Heat energy is primarily a result of the kinetic energy of the molecules or particles in a substance. It is important to note that heat itself is not stored in objects; rather, objects have internal energy (also known as thermal energy), which leads to a measurable temperature.\n\nBased on the understanding of these two facts, a thermal insulator slows the transfer of heat, which stems from the movement of thermal energy. This implies that a thermal insulator slows down the transfer of thermal energy between objects or systems, allowing them to maintain their respective temperatures and prevent heat loss or gain. The effectiveness of a thermal insulator depends on the materials used, their arrangement, and the specific mechanisms they target (conduction, convection, or radiation).\n\nIn conclusion, given Fact 1 and Fact 2, a thermal insulator slows down the transfer of thermal energy, or heat, between objects or systems, which results in conservation of temperature and prevention of heat loss or gain. This ability to slow heat transfer is essential in various industries and applications, including building construction, transportation, and the design of clothing and appliances, to achieve increased energy efficiency, comfort, and cost savings.", "token_count": 512}

His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrete works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers.\n\nZappa and the Mothers of Invention returned to Los Angeles in mid-1968, and the Zappas moved into a house on Laurel Canyon Boulevard, only to move again to one on Woodrow Wilson Drive. This was Zappa's home for the rest of his life. Despite being a success with fans in Europe, the Mothers of Invention were not faring well financially. Their first records were vocally oriented, but Zappa wrote more instrumental jazz and classical oriented music for the band's concerts, which confused audiences. Zappa felt that audiences failed to appreciate his \"electrical chamber music\".  In 1969 there were nine band members and Zappa was supporting the group himself from his publishing royalties whether they played or not. 1969 was also the year Zappa, fed up with MGM Records' interference, left them for Warner Bros. Records' Reprise subsidiary where Zappa/Mothers recordings would bear the Bizarre Records imprint.  In late 1969, Zappa broke up the band. He often cited the financial strain as the main reason, but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort. Many band members were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some took it as a sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling. Others were irritated by 'his autocratic ways', exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members. Several members played for Zappa in years to come. Remaining recordings with the band from this period were collected on Weasels Ripped My Flesh and Burnt Weeny Sandwich (both released in 1970).  After he disbanded the Mothers of Invention, Zappa released the acclaimed solo album Hot Rats (1969). It features, for the first time on record, Zappa playing extended guitar solos and contains one of his most enduring compositions, \"Peaches en Regalia\", which reappeared several times on future recordings. He was backed by jazz, blues and R&B session players including violinist Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris, drummers John Guerin and Paul Humphrey, multi-instrumentalist and previous member of the Mothers of Invention Ian Underwood, and multi-instrumentalist Shuggie Otis on bass, along with a guest appearance by Captain Beefheart (providing vocals to the only non-instrumental track, \"Willie the Pimp\").

Question: suppose the person does not have a lung disease happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen being brought to the body.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect\nAnswer:", "response": "B: Less\n\nWhen a person does not have a lung disease, their respiratory system would function normally, enabling proper oxygen uptake and distribution throughout the body. However, if there is a situation that leads to less oxygen being brought into the body, several consequences may manifest, affecting various bodily functions and processes.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of how lesser oxygen intake could affect an individual without lung disease:\n\n1. Difficulty in physical activities: Reduced oxygen levels can lead to muscle fatigue, shortness of breath, and difficulty sustaining physical activity for extended periods. Since muscles require oxygen for efficient functioning, less oxygen supply might limit muscle power and endurance.\n\n2. Impaired cognitive function: The brain is one of the most oxygen-demanding organs in the human body. An inadequate supply of oxygen could affect concentration, memory, decision-making abilities, and alertness, leading to poor cognitive performance.\n\n3. Decreased heart function: In an attempt to compensate for a lack of oxygen, the heart might pump more blood, causing an increased heart rate and, in some cases, palpitations. Over time, this increased workload can lead to heart-related issues, including heart failure and arrhythmias.\n\n4. Weakened immune system: A healthy immune system depends on consistent oxygen supply to function effectively. Reduced oxygen levels might weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to infections, illnesses, and delayed recovery from sickness.\n\n5. Anaerobic respiration increase: When the body does not have enough oxygen, cells will undergo anaerobic respiration to produce energy. This process results in the production of lactic acid, which can cause muscle fatigue and cramping.\n\n6. Slower healing process: Oxygen is essential for healing wounds, regenerating tissues, and for the overall recovery process. With less oxygen being brought into the body, the healing process slows down, leading to a higher risk of complications and infections.\n\nIn conclusion, when there is less oxygen being brought to the body, it can result in multiple detrimental effects on an individual's health and well-being, even in cases without underlying lung diseases. These effects include, but are not limited to, difficulties in physical activities, impaired cognitive function, decreased heart function, a weakened immune system, increased anaerobic respiration, and slower healing processes.", "token_count": 512}

The moneylender told them that he would put a black pebble and a white pebble into an empty bag. The girl would then have to pick one pebble from the bag.

The sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two black pebbles and put them into the bag. He then asked the girl to pick a pebble from the bag. No doubt she was caught in a dilemma.

Her plan for a quiet and peaceful retreat takes a dark turn when she realizes there is a sinister presence lurking in the shadows. Will she overcome her fears, or will time run out before she makes the decision to leave the cabin at dawn?\n\nAct 1:\nThe movie begins with Laura arriving at the secluded cabin, which she inherited from her late grandmother. She chose the cabin as an escape from the chaos and trauma that overwhelmed her following her sister's death. As Laura unpacks her belongings, she starts to feel a mysterious energy surrounding the cabin. She dismisses the feeling, attributing it to her emotional state and exhaustion.\n\nLaura begins exploring the wooded area around the cabin, discovering an old, abandoned church and a small cemetery at the edge of the forest. The church seems to be brimming with the same energy she felt earlier. Inside, she finds a ledger, which contains a journal entry from her grandmother. The entry reveals that on the night of her sister's funeral, Laura's grandmother held a séance in the cabin seeking contact with the spirit world.\n\nAct 2:\nAs night falls, Laura begins to experience strange occurrences in the cabin. The air grows cold, and objects start to move on their own. She begins to feel increasingly isolated and paranoid. Haunted by the thought of her sister's death, Laura spends sleepless nights pondering what she could have done to save her.\n\nOne night, during a violent storm, Laura is besieged by terrifying visions of her sister's last moments. Entrenched in her desperation and grief, Laura turns to the church and the same séance that her grandmother performed in search of answers. As she delves deeper into the world of the supernatural, she discovers that the spirits are not to be trifled with. She begins to believe that her sister's spirit, ridden with guilt and remorse, may be communicating with her.\n\nAct 3:\nAs her sanity hangs by a thread, Laura meets Tom, a kind-hearted and inquisitive neighbor. Tom offers his friendship and support, and the two bond over their shared experiences of loss. He explains that he faced similar struggles after losing his wife and found solace in a group therapy in the nearby town. He encourages Laura to attend the session to share her pain and let go of her anguish.\n\nThe night before the group therapy meeting, Laura's experiences escalate, culminating in a terrifying encounter with a dark and malevolent spirit. The evil spirit reveals itself as the orchestrator of not only her sister's misfortune but also of the destructive and sinister occurrences in her life.\n\nLaura decides to leave the cabin and confront the evil spirit head-on, recognizing that she cannot face this dark presence alone. As dawn approaches, she leaves the cabin, determined to return to the church and find a way to banish the malevolent presence that has plagued her life and seek redemption for her sister.\n\nConclusion:\nIn the end, Laura, along with Tom, confront and vanquish the evil spirit, restoring peace and safety to the cabin and the surrounding woods. Having discovered the extent of the spirit's manipulations, Laura embraces the healing power of forgiveness as she comes to terms with her sister's death. As Tom and Laura part ways, promising to remain close friends, a sense of closure fills the air, a testament to the lasting bond they have forged in the dark and unforgiving woods.", "token_count": 512}

He had one less pair of red socks than he had pairs of white socks. He had twice as many blue socks as he had of red socks. And he counted a total of 6 red socks. What is the total number of Joseph's socks? Give me reasons, before answering the question", "response": "Let's analyze the information given in the problem step by step:\n\n1. Joseph had three more pairs of blue socks than pairs of black socks.\nLet B be the number of pairs of blue socks and K be the number of pairs of black socks. Then, the relationship between them is:\nB = K + 3\n\n2. He had one less pair of red socks than pairs of white socks.\nLet R be the number of pairs of red socks and W be the number of pairs of white socks. Then, the relationship between them is:\nR = W - 1\n\n3. He had twice as many blue socks as he had red socks.\nWe know that Joseph had 6 red socks, so he has 3 pairs of red socks (since each pair has 2 socks). Therefore, R = 3. We can now find the number of pairs of blue socks using the relationship from point #3:\nB = 2 * R\nB = 2 * 3\nB = 6\n\n4. Now we can find the number of pairs of black and white socks.\nWe'll start with black socks. Using the relationship found in point #1 and the value of B, we can find K:\nB = K + 3\n6 = K + 3\nK = 3\n\nThen, we'll find the number of pairs of white socks. Since we already know R = 3 and the relationship from point #2:\nR = W - 1\n3 = W - 1\nW = 4\n\n5. Now that we know the number of pairs of each sock color, we can find the total number by multiplying each number of pairs by 2 (since each pair has 2 socks) and summing them up:\nTotal socks = 2 * (B + K + R + W)\nTotal socks = 2 * (6 + 3 + 3 + 4)\nTotal socks = 2 * (16)\nTotal socks = 32\n\nSo, Joseph has a total of 32 socks in his drawer.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_11463", "prompt": "Q: who wrote most of the pink floyd songs? A:", "response": "A: Roger Waters is credited with writing the majority of Pink Floyd's songs, a prominent British rock band formed in 1965. Initially, the band's primary songwriter was Syd Barrett during the early years of Pink Floyd. He contributed to their first album, \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\" released in 1967. Barrett's eccentric and experimental songwriting style set the foundation for Pink Floyd's distinct sound. However, due to his mental health issues and drug use, Barrett left the band in 1968, paving the way for Roger Waters to take over as the chief songwriter.\n\nBorn George Roger Waters on September 6, 1943, in Great Bookham, Surrey, England, Waters was one of the founding members of Pink Floyd, alongside Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright. Roger Waters primarily served as the bassist and vocalist for the band. As he gradually assumed the role of the main lyricist and creative force behind Pink Floyd, Waters became well-known for his complex and thought-provoking songwriting, often exploring themes such as politics, human nature, and personal experiences.\n\nWaters significantly contributed to iconic Pink Floyd albums such as:\n\n1. \"A Saucerful of Secrets\" (1968): Although this was Pink Floyd's second album, it was the first to feature Roger Waters' songwriting.\n2. \"Meddle\" (1971): Waters' songwriting became more prominent on this album, particularly in the 23-minute-long track \"Echoes.\"\n3. \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" (1973): Considered one of the greatest rock albums of all time, Waters wrote most of the lyrics for this groundbreaking record, exploring themes of life, death, mental illness, and societal pressures.\n4. \"Wish You Were Here\" (1975): Waters took on the primary songwriting duties for this album, delving into the music industry's dark side and paying tribute to Syd Barrett.\n5. \"Animals\" (1977): Waters wrote all the lyrics for this concept album, which offers a critical perspective on the social and political climate of the time.\n6. \"The Wall\" (1979): Perhaps Waters' magnum opus as a songwriter, \"The Wall\" is a rock opera that tells the story of a rock star's descent into madness. Waters' personal experiences heavily influenced this album.\n7. \"The Final Cut\" (1983): The last Pink Floyd album to feature Roger Waters, this anti-war album was primarily written by Waters as a reflection on war and its effects on people's lives.\n\nIn 1985, Waters left Pink Floyd due to creative differences and pursued a successful solo career. Although David Gilmour took over as the band's primary songwriter after Waters' departure, Roger Waters' contributions to Pink Floyd's music remain an influential and integral part of their legacy.", "token_count": 512}

While archaeological evidence of paper fragments dates back to the 2nd century BC in China, the advanced papermaking technique that Cai Lun developed in the early 2nd century AD was a crucial innovation. During the Han dynasty, the spread of paper production across China and beyond led to its increased use for writing and documentation purposes, replacing more cumbersome materials such as bamboo and silk.\n\nThat said, it is essential to mention that the earliest archaeological fragments of paper from the 2nd century BC in China were discovered at various sites, such as those in the Tarim Basin and the Gansu Province.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is a big fire happens, how will it affect more oxygen will reach the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?\nThe answer to this question is:", "response": "Yes, the supposed perturbation of a big fire happening can have both direct and indirect effects on the process, specifically on the availability of oxygen to reach the body and cellular respiration.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation:\n\n1. Direct Effects:\nWhen a big fire occurs, it consumes a significant amount of oxygen in the surrounding area. As the fire burns, it uses up oxygen and produces carbon dioxide, smoke, and other harmful gases. This can lead to a lower concentration of oxygen in the air, especially in closed or poorly ventilated areas. Since our cells rely on the continuous supply of oxygen to perform cellular respiration and produce energy, a reduced availability of oxygen due to the fire can stall the energy production process.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of smoke and harmful gases can cause respiratory issues that hinder the proper functioning of the respiratory system. This makes it difficult for the lungs to effectively extract oxygen from the air and deliver it to the cells. As a result, the cells might not receive enough oxygen, causing a strain on the energy production process and leading to inefficient cellular respiration.\n\n2. Indirect Effects:\nThe indirect effects of a big fire can also negatively impact the process of oxygen reaching the body and cellular respiration. For instance, stress and anxiety caused by the fire can stimulate the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones elevate the heart rate and cause rapid breathing, increasing the body's demand for oxygen. However, the fire has already reduced the availability of oxygen in the air, making it difficult for the body to meet its increased oxygen needs.\n\nAdditionally, prolonged exposure to high temperatures due to the fire can cause dehydration, heat exhaustion, or heatstroke. These conditions can lead to impaired respiratory and circulatory functions, interfering with the ability of the cardiovascular system to effectively transport oxygen to the body's cells. Consequently, the reduced supply of oxygen affects cellular respiration and energy production.\n\nIn conclusion, the perturbation created by a big fire can have significant direct and indirect effects on the process of oxygen reaching the body and cellular respiration. It leads to reduced oxygen availability in the air, respiratory difficulties, stress response, and impaired body functions, all of which hinder the efficient process of energy production in cells. This highlights the importance of ensuring proper safety measures and adequate ventilation in areas prone to fires or other emergencies.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_10343", "prompt": "Answer the following question: -  The plant roots begin to grow - Break apart the rock - The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock - The rocks are broken into more and more pieces - Erosion starts to occur.  What might be the first step of the process?\nAnswer:", "response": "The first step of the process, where plant roots begin to grow and eventually lead to the breakdown and erosion of rocks, is known as mechanical and chemical weathering. In this process, plants play a crucial role in the disintegration and decomposition of rocks, which further contributes to soil formation and the shaping of landscapes. Before diving into the explicit details of the first step, let's take a brief look at how the entire process unfolds.\n\n1. Plant root growth: The initial step involves the germination and growth of plant seeds in tiny cracks or fissures present within rocks. As the seedlings sprout, their roots begin to penetrate deeper into the rock crevices for anchorage and essential nutrients. These roots exert pressure on the rocks, causing them to fracture mechanically over time.\n\n2. Break apart the rock: As the plant roots continue to grow, they exert increasing amounts of force on the rock, leading to the expansion of existing cracks and the creation of new ones. Over time, this accumulating pressure causes larger portions of the rock to break apart, making it more vulnerable to further weathering processes.\n\n3. Plant acids dissolve parts of the rock: Plant roots release organic acids and other chemicals that can dissolve minerals within rocks. This process is known as chemical weathering and occurs alongside mechanical weathering. The chemical reactions between the plant-secreted substances and the rock minerals gradually weaken the rock's structural integrity, aiding in its disintegration.\n\n4. The rocks are broken into more and more pieces: As a result of the combined forces of mechanical and chemical weathering, the rock is fragmented into smaller and smaller pieces. These fragmented pieces are more easily weathered than the original rock, as they have a larger overall surface area exposed to both physical and chemical processes.\n\n5. Erosion starts to occur: Once the rocks have been significantly broken down into smaller pieces, they become more susceptible to erosion. Erosion involves the removal and transportation of these fragmented rock materials by various agents, such as water, wind, and ice. Over an extended period, the transportation and deposition of the broken rock pieces lead to reshaping landscapes and creating new geological formations.\n\nIn summary, the first step of this process is that plant roots begin to grow, specifically in small cracks within rocks. The roots then exert pressure on the rock, initiating mechanical weathering and eventually leading to chemical weathering. This combined action ultimately results in the fragmentation and erosion of rocks. The entire process showcases how the growth and activity of living organisms interact dynamically with their environment, participating in cycles of destruction and renewal that shape and reshape Earth's landscapes.", "token_count": 512}

It is a popular base for exploring Arthur's Pass National Park.  - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions.

It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - The Waimakariri River, formerly briefly known as the Courtenay River, is one of the largest of the North Canterbury rivers, in the South Island of New Zealand.

The river is known colloquially in Canterbury as \"The Waimak\".  - The Anti Crow River is a small river located in Arthur 's Pass National Park , Canterbury , New Zealand . It is a tributary of the Waimakariri River and is named because its valley is opposite that of the Crow River . Mount Damfool is at the head of the Anti Crow River valley .  - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.  - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents.

They also mention that it is a strong adaptation from the book which indicates that the story's essence may have been well-captured. \n\nThe reviewer also tips potential viewers on ways to enhance their viewing experience, suggesting that reading and enjoying the book before watching the movie would likely increase appreciation of the film.\n\nDespite recognizing that some fans may appreciate the film primarily as a \"drug-culture flick,\" the reviewer argues that the film goes deeper than that, painting a complex picture of two individuals searching desperately for their old world and challenging prevailing ideologies. \n\nGiven these points, the review would likely increase the chances of someone buying or investing time into this product, provided they have either a favourable view of the book or an interest in the themes the reviewer mentions. However, the statement \"Either you got the whole message and loved every minute or you couldn't wait for it to be over,\" signals a polarizing reaction; people may either love or hate it based on their personal preferences. \n\nSo overall, if the potential buyer aligns with the tastes of the reviewer or is intrigued by the challenge of fully \"getting the message,\" this review likely increases the chances of purchase.

Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogorou shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited. All passengers were evacuated, but Ran returned to her hiding place during the hide-and-seek game to find a \"gold medal\" made by sea-shells the Detective Boys made for her. However, as the ship swayed, she fainted in the enclosed area.It turns out Akiyoshi was the main murderer after all, and she was the one who did all three killings and made Kusaka think that he did them himself. She also revealed that her father was the captain who died while the cruise ship sank. Kogorou, however, deduced correctly this time and managed to arrest Akiyoshi.

{"id": "example_10539", "prompt": "Q:Question: where latin I found the following answer on Google: The classical Latin alphabet or Roman alphabet evolved from a western variety of the Greek alphabet called the Cumaean alphabet , which was adopted and modified by the Etruscans who ruled early Rome . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.\nA:", "response": "Yes, the answer you found on Google is correct, and I can provide a more detailed explanation to help ensure a comprehensive understanding of the origin and evolution of the Latin alphabet.\n\nThe Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, evolved over time through a series of adaptations and modifications of pre-existing writing systems. Its origins can be traced back to the Cumaean alphabet, which is an early variant of the Greek alphabet. The Cumaean alphabet was introduced to the Italian Peninsula by Greek colonists in the 8th century BCE. Cumae, a city located near modern-day Naples, served as the focal point for the spread of the Greek script in the region. The Cumaean alphabet contained 24 letters, which is two more than the standard Greek alphabet of the time.\n\nThe Etruscans, an advanced civilization in ancient Italy, adopted the Cumaean alphabet and adapted it to suit their language. The Etruscans were influential in the early development of Rome, having ruled over the city for a significant period of time. Consequently, their adapted Cumaean alphabet (the Etruscan alphabet) eventually found its way to the Romans, who further modified the alphabet to suit the Latin language.\n\nAs the Roman Empire expanded, the Latin alphabet became the dominant script throughout the realm. Over time, it also served as the basis for the modern writing systems of numerous European languages. Today, the Latin alphabet is the most widely used alphabet, comprising the foundation for many global languages, including English, French, German, and Spanish.\n\nIn summary, the Latin alphabet, or the Roman alphabet, ultimately originated from the Cumaean alphabet, which was a western variant of the Greek alphabet. The Etruscans played a significant role in the evolution of the alphabet, modifying the Cumaean alphabet to suit their needs before passing it on to the Romans. These adaptations led to the development of the Latin alphabet used across the Roman Empire and continued to evolve to form the basis of the alphabets used in many modern languages.", "token_count": 474}

Question: what happened to original pink power rangers\nA:", "response": "Yes, it is correct that the Power Rangers franchise underwent significant changes in 1996 and has since then continually introduced new elements from the Super Sentai series, along with a changing cast and evolving storylines. Consequently, the fate of the original Pink Power Ranger, also known as the character Kimberly Ann Hart, is as follows:\n\nKimberly Ann Hart, portrayed by actress Amy Jo Johnson, was the first Pink Power Ranger in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series, which initially aired from 1993 to 1995. As the Pink Ranger, Kimberly played an integral role in the team, demonstrating exceptional skills in gymnastics and combat, while also showing great intelligence and empathy.\n\nIn 1995, during the third season of the show, Kimberly received a letter granting her the opportunity to participate in the prestigious Pan Global Games as a gymnast. It was at this point that she decided to leave the Power Rangers to pursue her dream of becoming a world-class gymnast. To ensure the team's continuity, Kimberly passed on her Pink Power Ranger powers to Katherine \"Kat\" Hillard, who became the new Pink Ranger.\n\nAmy Jo Johnson, the actress who portrayed Kimberly, eventually exited the series as she wanted to move on with her acting career and explore new opportunities. After the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series, Kimberly's character did make a few appearances in later productions, such as Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie (1997).\n\nIn conclusion, the original Pink Power Ranger, Kimberly Ann Hart, left the team during the third season to pursue her gymnastics career and passed on her powers to Katherine Hillard. While the franchise has continued to evolve, rebrand, and incorporate elements from the Super Sentai series, the legacy of the original Pink Power Ranger remains an important part of the Power Rangers' history and has left a lasting impact on the series.", "token_count": 510}

{"id": "example_9088", "prompt": "Burke was born in Dublin, Ireland. His mother Mary nee Nagle (c. 1702-1770) was a Roman Catholic who hailed from a declasse County Cork family (and a cousin of Nano Nagle), whereas his father, a successful solicitor, Richard (died 1761), was a member of the Church of Ireland; it remains unclear whether this is the same Richard Burke who converted from Catholicism. The Burke dynasty descends from an Anglo-Norman knight surnamed de Burgh (Latinised as de Burgo) who arrived in Ireland in 1185 following Henry II of England's 1171 invasion of Ireland and is among the chief \"Gall\" families that assimilated into Gaelic society, becoming \"more Irish than the Irish themselves\". Burke adhered to his father's faith and remained a practising Anglican throughout his life, unlike his sister Juliana who was brought up as and remained a Roman Catholic.\n\nIn 1774, Burke's Speech to the Electors at Bristol at the Conclusion of the Poll was noted for its defence of the principles of representative government against the notion that elected officials should merely be delegates:  ... it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.  Political scientist Hanna Pitkin points out that Burke linked the interest of the district with the proper behaviour of its elected official, explaining, \"Burke conceives of broad, relatively fixed interest, few in number and clearly defined, of which any group or locality has just one. These interests are largely economic or associated with particular localities whose livelihood they characterize, in his over-all prosperity they involve.\"  Burke was a leading sceptic with respect to democracy. While admitting that theoretically, in some cases it might be desirable, he insisted a democratic government in Britain in his day would not only be inept, but also oppressive. He opposed democracy for three basic reasons. First, government required a degree of intelligence and breadth of knowledge of the sort that occurred rarely among the common people. Second, he thought that if they had the vote, common people had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by demagogues; he feared that the authoritarian impulses that could be empowered by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion, leading to violence and confiscation of property. Third, Burke warned that democracy would create a tyranny over unpopular minorities, who needed the protection of the upper classes.\n\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?", "response": "Yes, there are other interesting aspects in the article. One of them is about Burke's views on representative government: \"It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living.\" This quote shows how Burke believed that elected officials should balance the interests and opinions of their constituents with their own judgment and principles.", "token_count": 512}

Ringo Starr gets a sense of liberation and goes off on his own to find happiness only to land in jail for loitering.

Isberg asked former Eruption band member Mikael Åkerfeldt, who was just 16 years old at the time, to join Opeth as a bassist. When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that Åkerfeldt would be joining the band. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project. The band name was derived from the word \"Opet\", taken from the Wilbur Smith novel The Sunbird. In this novel, Opet is the name of a fictional Phoenician city in South Africa translated as \"City of the Moon\". Isberg and Åkerfeldt recruited drummer Anders Nordin, bassist Nick Döring, and guitarist Andreas Dimeo. Unsatisfied with Opeth's slow progress, Döring and Dimeo left the band after their first performance, and were replaced by guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist Johan De Farfalla. After the next show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany, and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander, before Åkerfeldt's friend Peter Lindgren took on the role of bassist.

The frequently changing status of the région throughout history has left its mark on modern day politics in terms of a particular interest in national identity issues. Alsace is also one of the most pro-EU regions of France. It was one of the few French regions that voted 'yes' to the European Constitution in 2005.\nWho was elected head of the Alsace Regional Council in 2007? (If the question is unanswerable, say \"unanswerable\")", "response": "Remember how I mentioned Philippe Richert being the president of the Regional Council in Alsace?

{"id": "example_1295", "prompt": "Newtown Residents Break Down as Obama Names 20 Children Killed in Massacre\nMourners listen to a memorial service over a loudspeaker outside Newtown High School for the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 16, 2012.\n\nThe first of Newtown’s residents began walking down the roadway while it was still daylight, more than three hours before President Obama was scheduled to speak. They started the trek at the main intersection in the village of Sandy Hook. On one corner, under a two-story Christmas tree, they paused to place stuffed animals, signs and flowers by the hundreds. On the other side of the village’s only stoplight, Riverside Drive leads up a hill to the site of the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n\nIt’s exactly one mile along Berkshire Road to Newtown High School, and they walked by the dozens, a few at first and then a steady stream through the freezing rain. When they reached the high school, they quietly formed an unbroken serpentine line that snaked through the parking lot. Those who weren’t from Newtown came from neighboring towns and villages, and from New York and New Jersey. A group of more than 100 Sikhs drove from four congregations in Massachusetts to show their solidarity with the people of Newtown. “We were devastated when one of our places of worship was attacked,” says Sarbpreet Singh, referring to the August shooting at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek. “We are no less devastated today.”\n\n(PHOTOS: Connecticut Community Copes After School Shooting)\n\nAs volunteers from the Red Cross moved up and down the line, handing out blankets and stuffed toys for the children, the gymnasium where the President was to speak filled up, and the remaining crowd members were told they would be sent to overflow rooms. Some left, saying they could do better watching at home, but the vast majority stayed in line, wishing, at the very least, to be gathered with others while searching for answers as to why one young local resident had murdered 20 of Newtown’s young children.\n\nIt is a question that has plagued this town since 9:30 a.m. on Dec. 14, when the first reports emerged of a shooting at the school. Over the weekend, with each new detail, the madness behind it all seemed to grow exponentially until it seemed greater than the sum of its parts. After shooting his mother in the head, 20-year-old Adam Lanza drove to the elementary school, shot the principal and other members of the staff and then, using a weapon similar to those carried by soldiers and Marines, fired bullets meant to kill insurgents into the bodies of children still young enough to have their baby teeth. Later reports from police officials said Lanza had hundreds of rounds left over when he took his own life.\n\nAfter 2½ days of grieving, crying, praying and questioning, the people of Newtown turned out in droves for the visit from the President. The Commander in Chief, who in his tenure has had to be comforter in chief for five mass shootings, three hurricanes, two tornadoes and a giant oil spill, faced the challenge of trying to catalyze the process of healing amid anger, disbelief and sorrow. Many expected Obama to talk about gun control, which has leaped to the forefront of national discourse in a way that didn’t occur after the massacre in Aurora, Colo., in July. He would, but without using the word gun once. Others wanted compassion and understanding, and a discussion of the broader complexities of guns, mental illness, the culture of violence and how our busy, digitally connected lives sometimes leave young people to be forgotten. He would too. The speech would be greater than the sum of its parts.\n\n(MORE: Mass Murder: Why Are Schools Such a Common Target?)\n\nSunday night’s vigil was an interfaith service, with readings from Jewish traditions, the Koran and Scripture. Monsignor Raymond Weiss of St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church, who would help close the ceremony after the President spoke, had tried to comfort congregants on the night of the tragedy, saying, “There are 20 brighter stars in the heavens.” It was a metaphor that resonated in the community.\n\nWhen Obama took to the stage, he acknowledged the similarities of the eclectic teachings, each of which reflected a search for answers to the tragedy. “All the world’s religions — so many of them represented here today — start with a simple question: Why are we here? What gives our life meaning?” he said.\n\n“We know our time on this earth is fleeting,” he continued. “We know that we will each have our share of pleasure and pain … We know that no matter how good our intentions, we will all stumble sometimes, in some way. We will make mistakes; we will experience hardships. And even when we’re trying to do the right thing, we know that much of our time will be spent groping through the darkness, so often unable to discern God’s heavenly plans.”\n\n(MORE: ‘These Tragedies Must End’: Obama Promises Change at Newtown Vigil, but Can He Deliver?)\n\nObama issued a call to action — of sorts — with a rhetorical question that may well prove to be a rallying argument for new gun-control legislation. “Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom?” he asked. And yet it was not an overtly political speech. It was religious in focus and solemn in tone, and for the dozens of people left out in the cold when the school reached capacity, it seemed to provide some measure of the comfort they had been seeking. They huddled together for warmth and reassurance; some held candles, nodding to the President’s message that life is precious but also fleeting.\n\nFinally, the gathered mourners listened between tears and sobs as the President, who earlier in the speech named the school staff members who died in the shooting, began a litany of the 20 children, pausing briefly but meaningfully between each name: “Charlotte, Daniel, Olivia, Josephine, Ana, Dylan, Madeleine, Catherine, Chase, Jesse, James, Grace, Emilie, Jack, Noah, Caroline, Jessica, Benjamin, Avielle, Allison.” Twenty brighter stars in the heavens.\n\nMORE: Funerals at Christmastime: Newtown Prepares to Mourn\nWhat was this article about?", "response": "This article is about a memorial service that happened in Newtown, after a very sad event where a young man named Adam Lanza hurt many people at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

In 1997, In medias res, officer Captain Oliveira (Marcelo Valle) and his colleagues are shown driving through Morro da BabilÃ´nia towards a baile funk. Nascimento and his other colleagues are also shown in their armored car. Meanwhile, novice police officers AndrÃ© Matias (AndrÃ© Ramiro) and Neto Gouveia (Caio Junqueira) are shown riding a motorcycle at the same favela, though not with the other officers. Once they make it to a vantage point, Neto uses the telescope of a sniper rifle to check on the police team as they talk to some drug traffickers. Neto shoots one of them and provokes a deadly gunfight between police and thugs, both sides unaware of where the bullet came from, forcing Mathias and Neto to flee the scene. Nascimento leads his colleagues from BOPE, Rio Special Police Department, heading to the shootout to interfere and save the officers. Six months earlier, Nascimento and his wife Rosane (Maria Ribeiro) are shown during her pregnancy of their first child. Not wanting to be an absent father when his child is born, Nascimento decides to search for a successor for his role as a captain, since he will be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. This coincides with an operation he will have to lead at Morro dos Prazeres in order to secure the location and clean it of drug dealers, so that Pope John Paul II can spend the night in the Archbishop's home, located near the slum buildings and favelas. The operation will require daily trips into the favela filled with heavily armed drug lords, and Nascimento is initially against it, but is forced by his superiors to accept it as his last mission, due to Pope's regards and requirements which cannot be annulled.

{"id": "example_8", "prompt": "What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?\nOne of the first complaints presented to doctors by many people later diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease is an involuntary tremor or shaking of the hands, fingers, arms, legs, jaw, and face. You’re most likely to notice this tremor when your hands are at rest rather than when you’re using them, although you may see more tremors while your hands and arms are in use as the disease progresses.  There are many causes of tremors. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common causes, and tremors are often the first sign of the disease. The tremor and other symptoms may initially appear only on one side of the body, or they may appear worse on one side than the other. A repetitive “pill-rolling\" movement between the thumb and finger—named because it looks as though the person is rolling a pill between their fingers—is characteristic of a Parkinsonian tremor. Some symptoms of Parkinson's are caused by the larger symptom of slowed movements (also known as bradykinesia). This primarily affects motor functions from walking and balance to writing and even motor functions that are often considered reflexive or spontaneous.  These slowed movements are a very common early sign of Parkinson’s, and may show up at the onset of the disease in 80% of patients. Some people might have a hard time describing what they are feeling and use words like “weakness,” “tiredness,” or “incoordination” when talking about these symptoms. Look for distortions in voluntary movements. In addition to involuntary movements, those with Parkinson’s may experience disturbances in their voluntary movements beyond just slowness. Some of the treatments used for Parkinson's disease may cause abnormal involuntary movements, or an increase in movement, referred to as dyskinesia. These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress. Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time. A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson's often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a \"festinating gait,\" and it is very common in Parkinson's disease. This symptom typically shows up in the later stages of the disease. Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson's can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down.  Rigidity can affect the whole body, and might you feel stiff or sore. Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow. Cog-wheeling may happen when the increased muscle tone related to rigidity is combined with a tremor. Some cognitive impairment is common, but usually not until late in the course of the disease. Around 90% of those with PD will show signs of speech disturbances at some point. These can present as quieter speech, breathy or hoarse qualities to the voice, and reduced precision with language. The voice often becomes soft or whispery because the vocal muscles lack mobility. Up to 60% of those with PD may show signs or anxiety or depression. PD affects some of the mood-stabilizing portions of the brain, which leads to this increased chance for depression, especially paired with the quality of life for patients in late stages of the disease. The muscles used to push food through the digestive system are also affected by PD. This can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal issues from incontinence to constipation. These same symptoms often present along with difficulty swallowing food as well. Many of the involuntary movements associated with Parkinson’s make it increasingly difficult for those with the disease to get a full night of sleep. Other symptoms—such as muscle rigidity making it difficult to roll over at night or bladder issues leading to getting up at night to urinate frequently—compound the sleep disruptions experienced by those with PD.\n\nSummary:", "response": "Involuntary tremors, slowed movements, and posture and balance issues are common early symptoms of Parkinson's Disease, often accompanied by disturbances in voluntary movements, speech, mood, and gastrointestinal issues as the disease progresses.", "token_count": 512}

However, they also bear the responsibility to ensure the accuracy of their reporting and respect individuals' reputations. In this specific case happening in East China's Anhui Province, there involves an ex-official convicted of graft who has become the center of attention.\n\nGraft is a form of corruption where an official uses their station or status to gain personal benefit, violating their duties and the rights of others. It's a widespread issue in many regions around the world, and China, unfortunately, is no stranger to it, having encountered several high-profile graft cases throughout its recent history.\n\nThe disgraced official in question here decided to take legal action against a reporter. This reporter's alleged claim is that this official traded sexual favors in return for career advancement, a serious charge that adds a different, potentially more pernicious layer to the graft conviction. These allegations imply that she had exploited her sexuality to achieve her professional objectives, which, if true, gives a darker undertone to the initial graft case.\n\nOn the other hand, if these accusations are unfounded, they can represent a case of defamation, which is the act of damaging someone's good reputation by making false statements. Defamation can be extremely harmful, leading to serious emotional distress and damage to a person's reputation that can be hard to repair. Therefore, it's understandable why the ex-official would want to defend herself against such serious allegations, even amidst a graft conviction.\n\nThis case represents a complex blend of corruption and potential defamation, all of which will need to be carefully investigated to ensure that justice is done. Regardless of the lawsuit's outcome, it underscores the need for greater transparency, accountability, and respect for individual rights in both the realm of politics and journalism. This incident will no doubt spark debate on the dynamics of power, gender, and media ethics, particularly in regions like East China's Anhui Province where graft has been an issue. \n\nUltimately, the ramifications of this case will extend beyond just the individuals involved, potentially leading to increased scrutiny of corruption and media practices in the region and perhaps in other parts of China as well.", "token_count": 512}

November 8] 1894) was a Russian pianist, composer and conductor who became a pivotal figure in Russian culture when he founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. He was the elder brother of Nikolai Rubinstein who founded the Moscow Conservatory. As a pianist, Rubinstein ranks among the great 19th-century keyboard virtuosos.\n\nRubinstein was born to Jewish parents in the village of Vikhvatinets in the Podolia Governorate, Russian Empire (now known as Ofatinti in Transnistria, Republic of Moldova), on the Dniestr River, about 150 kilometres (93 mi) northwest of Odessa. Before he was 5 years old, his paternal grandfather ordered all members of the Rubinstein family to convert from Judaism to Russian Orthodoxy. Although he was raised as a Christian, Rubinstein would later return to being atheist.  Rubinstein's father opened a pencil factory in Moscow. His mother, a competent musician, began giving him piano lessons at five, until the teacher Alexander Villoing heard and accepted Rubinstein as a non-paying student. Rubinstein made his first public appearance at a charity benefit concert at the age of nine. Later that year Rubinstein's mother sent him, accompanied by Villoing, to Paris where he sought unsuccessfully to enroll at the Paris Conservatoire.  Rubinstein and Villoing remained in Paris for a year. In December 1840, Rubinstein played in the Salle Erard for an audience that included Frederic Chopin and Franz Liszt. Chopin invited Rubinstein to his studio and played for him. Liszt advised Villoing to take him to Germany to study composition; however, Villoing took Rubinstein on an extended concert tour of Europe and Western Russia. They finally returned to Moscow in June 1843. Determined to raise money to further the musical careers of both Anton and his younger brother Nikolai, their mother sent Rubinstein and Villoing on a tour of Russia, following which the brothers were dispatched to Saint Petersburg to play for Tsar Nicholas I and the Imperial family at the Winter Palace. Anton was 14 years old; Nikolai was eight.  By 1867, ongoing tensions with the Balakirev camp, along with related matters, led to intense dissension within the Conservatory's faculty. Rubinstein resigned and returned to touring throughout Europe. Unlike his previous tours, he began increasingly featuring the works of other composers. In previous tours, Rubinstein had played primarily his own works.  At the behest of the Steinway & Sons piano company, Rubinstein toured the United States during the 1872-3 season. Steinway's contract with Rubinstein called on him to give 200 concerts at the then unheard-of rate of 200 dollars per concert (payable in gold--Rubinstein distrusted both United States banks and United States paper money), plus all expenses paid. Rubinstein stayed in America 239 days, giving 215 concerts--sometimes two and three a day in as many cities.  Rubinstein wrote of his American experience,  May Heaven preserve us from such slavery! Under these conditions there is no chance for art--one simply grows into an automaton, performing mechanical work; no dignity remains to the artist; he is lost.... The receipts and the success were invariably gratifying, but it was all so tedious that I began to despise myself and my art. So profound was my dissatisfaction that when several years later I was asked to repeat my American tour, I refused pointblank...  Despite his misery, Rubinstein made enough money from his American tour to give him financial security for the rest of his life. Upon his return to Russia, he \"hastened to invest in real estate\", purchasing a dacha in Peterhof, not far from Saint Petersburg, for himself and his family.  Villoing had worked with Rubinstein on hand position and finger dexterity. From watching Liszt, Rubinstein had learned about freedom of arm movement. Theodor Leschetizky, who taught piano at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory when it opened, likened muscular relaxation at the piano to a singer's deep breathing. He would remark to his students about \"what deep breaths Rubinstein used to take at the beginning of long phrases, and also what repose he had and what dramatic pauses.\"  In his book The Great Pianists, former New York Times critic Harold C. Schonberg describes Rubinstein's playing as that \"of extraordinary breadth, virility and vitality, immense sonority and technical grandeur in which all too often technical sloppiness asserted itself.\" When caught up in the moment of performance, Rubinstein did not seem to care how many wrong notes he played as long as his conception of the piece he was playing came through. Rubinstein himself admitted, after a concert in Berlin in 1875, \"If I could gather up all the notes that I let fall under the piano, I could give a second concert with them.\"  Part of the problem might have been the sheer size of Rubinstein's hands. They were huge, and many observers commented on them. Josef Hofmann observed that Rubinstein's fifth finger \"was as thick as my thumb--think of it! Then his fingers were square at the ends, with cushions on them. It was a wonderful hand.\" Pianist Josef Lhevinne described them as \"fat, pudgy ... with fingers so broad at the finger-tips that he often had difficulty in not striking two notes at once.\" The German piano teacher Ludwig Deppe advised American pianist Amy Fay to watch carefully how Rubinstein struck his chords: \"Nothing cramped about him! He spreads his hands as if he were going to take in the universe, and takes them up with the greatest freedom and abandon!\"  Because of the slap-dash moments in Rubinstein's playing, some more academic, polished players, especially German-trained ones, seriously questioned Rubinstein's greatness. Those who valued interpretation as much or more than pure technique found much to praise. Pianist and conductor Hans von Bulow called Rubinstein \"the Michelangelo of music.\" The German critic Ludwig Rellstab called him \"the Hercules of the piano; the Jupiter Tonans of the instrument.\"\n\nDid he enroll somewhere else?", "response": "Yes, Anton Rubinstein did enroll somewhere else after not being able to join the Paris Conservatoire. He continued to learn piano from his teacher, Alexander Villoing. Villoing took him for an extended concert tour across Europe and Western Russia before they returned to Moscow in June 1843. Then, Rubinstein and his brother Nikolai were sent to Saint Petersburg to play for Tsar Nicholas I and the Imperial family at the Winter Palace. Over time, Rubinstein gained more knowledge, experience, and recognition, eventually becoming a pivotal figure in Russian culture when he founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.", "token_count": 512}

Toy stores carry a variety of children's toys, games, and activities, making them the most logical and common sense choice for finding a wagon. These stores specialize in providing items that are designed for children's play, ensuring that the wagon will be suitable and safe for a child. Toy stores usually have a wide array of options, including different sizes, colors, and designs of wagons, allowing the child and their parents to select the best one according to their preferences and needs.\n\nThe other options do not align with common sense as they are less likely places to find a child's wagon:\n\nA. Field - A field is typically an open area of land used primarily for agriculture or recreational activities, and it is not a place where one would normally find a wagon for purchase.\n\nB. Garage - While it is possible that a child's wagon could be stored in someone's garage, a garage is not a location where wagons are typically sold or distributed.\n\nC. Bookstore - Bookstores primarily sell books and related merchandise. However, a child's wagon is not related to books or reading materials and is unlikely to be found in a bookstore.\n\nD. Backyard - Although a child's wagon may be found in a person's backyard as they use it, this location is not appropriate for sourcing a wagon as a new purchase. One's own backyard is not a store or a place where wagons are available for sale.\n\nIt is important to remember that the primary goal is to find a location where a child can obtain a wagon. In this case, the most logical and common-sense option is a toy store, as these establishments specialize in providing children's toys and are more likely to have an ample selection of wagons available for purchase.", "token_count": 430}

{"id": "example_10994", "prompt": "Read this: As a result of the now near-universal human reliance upon agriculture, the few contemporary hunter-gatherer cultures usually live in areas unsuitable for agricultural use.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): Ancient hunter-gatherer cultures lived where?", "response": "Ancient hunter-gatherer cultures lived in diverse environments across the globe, inhabiting various landscapes that were rich in food resources, offered protection from predators, and supported their nomadic way of life. As human populations grew and agriculture was developed, these early societies occupied places where they could take advantage of local plant and animal populations. Some key types of environments where ancient hunter-gatherer cultures lived include:\n\n1. Forests and Woodlands: Dense forests and woodlands provided an abundance of resources for ancient hunter-gatherers. These areas supported a diverse array of plant and animal life, which facilitated the gathering of edible plants, nuts, fruits, and fungi, as well as the hunting of animals and birds. Examples of these cultures include the Aka people of central Africa and the Pygmies of the Congo Basin.\n\n2. Grasslands and Savannahs: Ancient hunter-gatherers living in the open grasslands and savannahs relied heavily on the hunting of game animals such as deer, bison, or antelope. Vegetation in these regions was relatively sparse, which necessitated a greater focus on animal-based subsistence strategies. Examples of these cultures include the !Kung people of the Kalahari Desert in Southern Africa and the traditional Aboriginal Australians.\n\n3. Coastal and Riverine Environments: Coastal and riverine environments provided ancient hunter-gatherers with a diverse array of food resources, such as fish, shellfish, and waterfowl. These areas also offered easy transportation routes and access to a wider range of habitats, which contributed to the success of these communities. Examples of these cultures include the Native American tribes of the Pacific Northwest Coast, such as the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian, and the Ainu people of northern Japan.\n\n4. Mountainous Regions: Ancient hunter-gatherer societies living in mountainous regions adapted to a rugged environment with colder and more unpredictable weather. They focused on hunting game animals, such as deer, elk, and mountain goats, and gathering available plant resources. Examples of these cultures include the Andean Quechua people and the nomadic tribes of the Himalayas, such as the Sherpa.\n\n5. Arctic Regions: Hunter-gatherers living in the harsh, cold environment of the Arctic relied predominantly on the hunting of large marine mammals, such as seals, walruses, and whales, as well as caribou and fish. These societies developed specialized tools and strategies for survival in these extreme conditions. Examples of these cultures include the Inuit people of Greenland and the Yupik and Inupiat peoples of Alaska.\n\nIn conclusion, ancient hunter-gatherer cultures lived in a wide variety of environments, from dense forests to open grasslands, and from coastal regions to mountainous and even Arctic areas. Their choice of habitation often depended on the availability of abundant food sources, the presence of suitable shelter, and other resources that allowed them to maintain a nomadic lifestyle.", "token_count": 512}
{"id": "example_2652", "prompt": "You are given a new situation: David was conducting experiments on chemical equilibrium in the chemistry lab. First, he took a chemical system that was at equilibrium. He labeled it as case E. Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored.  and a hint : Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.  Please answer this question : Would the reactants concentration increase or decrease in case A than in case B?", "response": "In order to answer this question, let's first review the given information and recall Le Châtelier's principle, which states that when a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a stress, the system will attempt to counteract the stress by adjusting the equilibrium until a new balance is established. In cases A and B, both represent disturbed equilibriums with different stress factors that favored either the forward or the reverse reactions.\n\nIn case A, the forward reaction is favored. This means that the reactants are being consumed to form products at a faster rate than the reverse reaction. As a result of this disturbance, the system is no longer at equilibrium and will attempt to re-establish equilibrium by favoring the forward reaction. Consequently, the concentration of the reactants will decrease, and the concentration of the products will increase. The chemical system will continue to shift in this direction until a new equilibrium is reached.\n\nIn case B, the reverse reaction is favored. This means that the products are being consumed to form reactants at a faster rate than the forward reaction. The disturbance in equilibrium causes the system to respond by favoring the reverse reaction. This will result in an increase in the concentration of the reactants and a decrease in the concentration of the products. The chemical system will continue to adjust until a new equilibrium is established.\n\nTo address the question, in case A, the concentration of the reactants would decrease compared to case B, where the concentration of the reactants would increase. This outcome results from the different reactions being favored in each scenario based on the applied stress, according to Le Châtelier's principle.", "token_count": 512}

One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological  and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their  projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...

Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under $1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\" Dudovitz said. \"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to $20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \"The job is more satisfying than the money,\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said.

Choices:  - membrane  - fruit  - mutation  - protein  A:", "response": "Unlike eukaryotic cells, DNA and RNA synthesis in prokaryotic cells occurs together with the synthesis of proteins.\n\nProkaryotic cells are characterized by their simplicity and lack of internal cellular compartments. They are the most ancient form of life and include bacteria and archaea. Unlike eukaryotic cells, which have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, prokaryotic cells have no nucleus and their DNA is not separated from the rest of the cell contents. This unique organization allows for simultaneous transcription and translation, processes that are separated in space and time in eukaryotic cells.\n\nDNA synthesis, or replication, in prokaryotic cells occurs in the cytoplasm, where the DNA is located. This process is initiated by enzymes that untwist and unzip the DNA double helix, creating a replication fork. DNA polymerase enzymes then help synthesize a complementary strand of DNA for each of the original strands, resulting in two identical copies of the DNA molecule.\n\nRNA synthesis, or transcription, also takes place in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells. The process starts when an enzyme, called RNA polymerase, binds to a specific sequence on the DNA, known as the promoter. The DNA is then unwound, and RNA polymerase synthesizes a complementary RNA molecule using one of the DNA strands as a template.\n\nThe coupling of transcription and translation in prokaryotic cells is referred to as \"co-transcriptional translation\" or \"coupled transcription and translation.\" Unlike eukaryotic cells, where transcription occurs in the nucleus and the mRNA must be processed and transported to the cytoplasm for translation, prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and other cellular compartments. As a result, transcription and translation can occur simultaneously.\n\nWhen the mRNA is being synthesized during transcription, ribosomes can already bind to the mRNA molecule and begin translating it into a protein sequence. This means that protein synthesis starts while the mRNA is still being formed. This coupling of processes allows prokaryotic cells to have a faster rate of gene expression and protein synthesis as compared to eukaryotic cells, enabling them to quickly respond and adapt to changes in their environment.\n\nIn summary, unlike eukaryotic cells, DNA and RNA synthesis in prokaryotic cells occurs together with the synthesis of proteins. This simultaneous process results from the lack of compartmentalization within the prokaryotic cell and provides them with a faster rate of gene expression and protein production as compared to their eukaryotic counterparts.", "token_count": 512}

The British settlers who had remained also resented Spanish rule, leading to a rebellion in 1810 and the establishment for ninety days of the so-called Free and Independent Republic of West Florida on September 23. After meetings beginning in June, rebels overcame the Spanish garrison at Baton Rouge (now in Louisiana), and unfurled the flag of the new republic: a single white star on a blue field. This flag would later become known as the \"Bonnie Blue Flag\".\n\nNow answer this question: What is known as the Bonnie Blue Flag", "response": "The Bonnie Blue Flag is a historical banner that consists of a single white, five-pointed star on a blue field. The name \"Bonnie Blue Flag\" comes from the Scottish word \"bonnie,\" which means beautiful or lovely. This flag is most famously associated with the short-lived Free and Independent Republic of West Florida, which existed for ninety days in 1810, after a rebellion against Spanish rule.\n\nThe rebellion started on September 23, 1810, when British settlers who remained in the region, along with American settlers, overcame the Spanish garrison at Baton Rouge (currently in Louisiana). They declared their independence and formed the Free and Independent Republic of West Florida, which was an insurgency against Spanish authority. This newly established republic adopted the single white star on a blue field as its flag.\n\nThe Bonnie Blue Flag represents the desire for freedom and independence during that time. The flag would later gain even more historical significance when it was adopted as an unofficial banner of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. It became a symbol of secession and southern autonomy for those who supported the Confederate cause.\n\nIn conclusion, the Bonnie Blue Flag is an emblem with a rich history, originating from the short-lived Republic of West Florida. It symbolizes the struggle for freedom and independence during the early 19th century and has become a significant part of American history due to its associations with the Confederate States of America during the Civil War.", "token_count": 445}

The widespread availability of internet access and various mobile devices like tablets and smartphones has opened the door to incorporating new digital teaching methodologies. This has led to discussions amongst educators, policy-makers, and researchers about the impact of technology on student learning outcomes.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nIntegrating technology in the classroom will lead to improved student learning outcomes, increased engagement, and a more personalized learning experience.\n\nIn order to examine this hypothesis, various aspects of technology integration in classrooms will be evaluated, including how the use of technology affects various types of learners, the role of teacher training and support, and the potential benefits and challenges of implementing technology in education.\n\n1. Different types of learners:\nTechnology can be especially helpful for students with diverse learning needs, such as those with learning disabilities or other challenges that make traditional classroom learning difficult. Online resources and adaptive learning platforms can offer a more personalized learning experience for these students, enabling them to access information at their own pace and in a format that suits their needs.\n\n2. Teacher training and support:\nThe success of incorporating technology in the classroom will largely depend on the competency of educators in using these tools effectively. This can be achieved through comprehensive training and support that address not only the technical aspects of implementing technology but also the pedagogical strategies required to create meaningful learning experiences for students.\n\n3. Potential benefits of integrating technology in the classroom:\n- Increased student engagement: The use of interactive and multimedia content, such as videos, simulations, and games, can help enhance students' understanding of complex concepts and maintain their interest in the subject matter.\n- Personalization of learning experience: Technology allows teachers to track each student's progress and tailor their instruction accordingly, addressing individual learning gaps and providing targeted support.\n- Collaboration and communication: Online platforms and tools can facilitate real-time collaboration amongst students, promoting critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills.\n- Increased accessibility: Technology can break down geographical barriers, providing students in remote areas or those with limited mobility access to quality education.\n\n4. Challenges of integrating technology in the classroom:\n- Equity and access: Not all schools and students have access to the necessary resources and infrastructure required for effectively implementing technology in the classroom.\n- Over-reliance on technology: The risk of prioritizing technology over pedagogical strategies, hindering effective learning and potentially creating a negative impact on student outcomes.\n- Data privacy and security: The protection of student data and privacy is an essential concern when using online platforms and tools.\n\nIn conclusion, the hypothesis suggests that the integration of technology in the classroom has the potential to improve student learning outcomes, increase engagement, and provide a more personalized learning experience. However, it is crucial to address the challenges and ensure that educators receive the necessary training and support to effectively implement technology in the classroom for it to be a truly transformative tool in education.", "token_count": 512}
{"id": "example_12647", "prompt": "Summarize the following:\nA tent is the most common source of shelter used when camping.  If you haven’t set up your tent before, set it up in your yard once or twice before you arrive at your campsite to get some practice. Tents come in many different sizes.  If you’re camping alone, you could get a small, single-person tent.  If you’re camping with someone else, get a tent that accommodates both of you. If you plan on going hiking or climbing during your camping trip, you’ll want a backpack.  The size of the pack you decide to bring depends on how far you’ll be hiking.  Longer, more intense hikes will require a larger and sturdier backpack, while easier day hikes will only require a small day pack.  Backpacks are either frameless, or have an internal or external frame.  Internal frame packs tend to be more expensive and sit flush against your back. External frame packs are more affordable and tend to provide more ventilation.  However, they are bulkier than internal frame packs. Smaller day packs that don’t hold much are usually frameless. A sturdy rope has lots of uses when camping.  You can use it as a clothesline, or cut it into various lengths in order to hang pots or bind your sleeping pad to your backpack. You'll want to store and coil your rope correctly when you pack it to avoid tangling. A tarp can provide additional protection for the bottom of your tent, or it can be stretched over your tent to keep it extra-dry.  The size of the tarp you get depends on the size of your tent.  The larger your tent, the larger the tarp you bring along. A battery-powered flashlight or headlamp is important for helping you find your way around your campsite after dark. Headlamps can be useful to complete tasks around your campsite, as your hands will be free.  Be sure to pack extra batteries. You might also want to bring a battery-powered lantern. Collapsible camping chairs are perfect for sitting around the fire or just lounging around the campsite.  The best camping chairs are lightweight and sold in specialty backpacking stores. If you’re camping with a group, advise each person in your party to bring a foldable camping chair of their own.\n\nSummary:", "response": "When camping, a tent is a crucial shelter, with sizes varying based on the number of campers.

They’ve proved far less generous to the gig economy grunts who pack boxes in fulfillment centers, drive people from A to B or deliver food—typically working them hard for minimum wages and few or no benefits. In recent months that strategy has started to reach its limits. Companies from Handy to Instacart have battled lawsuits alleging contractors should be considered employees and receive more compensation. Tesla and Amazon workers have reportedly passed out from exhaustion. Uber drivers have been sleeping in their cars. \n  \n Chieh Huang has chosen to do things differently. Huang is chief executive officer of Boxed, a New York e-commerce company with ambitions of becoming the next Costco Wholesale Corp. Boxed sells a narrow assortment of staples–toilet paper, pet food, toothpaste–and relies on several hundred full-time employees toiling in four fulfillment centers to sort, pack and ship the products to customers around the U.S. Huang treats those workers exactly the same as his engineers. \n  \n Not only do all full-time Boxed employees get shares in the company—a rarity in the startup world—and unlimited parental leave, Huang also pays for weddings and college tuition for workers' children, unique policies that cost tens of thousands of dollars per beneficiary. By comparison, a ping pong table costs a few hundred bucks. In Huang’s words, the \"people who move atoms\" are just as important as those who \"move bits and bytes.\" \n  \n Huang, 35, is an easygoing and approachable boss, as comfortable presenting quarterly results to the board as he is joking around with workers packing boxes. The son of Chinese immigrants who worked menial jobs for lousy money, he always vowed to treat employees well if he started a business. That said, Huang knows he’s bucking conventional wisdom. When he laid out his benefits plan to investors, he says, some “were like: ‘what the hell are you doing?'” Spending money on perks and an outsize focus on warehouse workers' well-being could delay Boxed's path to profitability and prove a hard sell on Wall Street once the company files to go public. \n  \n Chieh Huang Photographer: Misha Friedman/Bloomberg \n  \n Huang’s benevolence shouldn’t be mistaken solely for altruism, however. Turnover among warehouse workers tends to be high—according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, about a fifth of people working in the warehousing, transportation and utilities industries quit their jobs last year. That’s the highest turnover rate in a decade and probably will become more acute as the U.S. approaches full employment. Once you take into account recruiting and training, it can cost as much as $28,000 to replace one of these workers, says Bowling Green State University professor Hokey Min. \n  \n Besides offering generous benefits, Huang has also set out to create a worker-friendly culture. Dressed down in a nondescript T-shirt and jeans, he visits the fulfillment centers to say hello, ask for comments and thank workers for doing the work. During a recent visit to a facility in Union, New Jersey, Huang exchanged a bro hug with one worker, cleaned up some trash and lugged a pallet to a recycling location. One day Barbara Ward, recently promoted to box packer and still getting used to her new job, had room left in a package and asked the guy stuffing boxes at the next station for advice. Only later did she realize it was Huang. \"You could be working next to him forever,” says Ward, 56, “and you would have no idea who he is.\" \n  \n Persuading workers to stick around tends to make them more engaged and productive. And while difficult to quantify, there's a strong correlation between a positive company culture and the bottom line. \"I've seen businesses crumble because of bad culture,\" says Hadley Harris, a partner at Eniac Ventures, which has participated in Boxed funding rounds. \"Finding new people is hard and having turnover in your employees is one of the worst drags on a business.\" \n  \n Huang designed the benefits to help the workers he deemed most in need. Boxed warehouse employees tend to hail from less privileged backgrounds and be in their 30s, 40s and 50s–ages when people typically start thinking about settling down and starting a family. Hence the offer to pay for weddings and tuition. So far the retention strategy seems to be working. Only 25 employees have quit since Boxed’s founding in 2013, 15 from the fulfillment centers. Veronica Mena, 33, started last year, plans to go back to school part-time and wants to manage a facility. A mother of three, she intends to take advantage of the tuition perk once her kids are old enough. \n  \n Huang says he’s able to afford such generous employee packages because Boxed operations are so efficient. Company software figures out how to pack products into the minimal number of boxes—ideally one—which cuts down on shipping costs. Because the company sells in bulk, the average consumer orders more than $100 worth of stuff at a time, much larger than a typical e-tailer selling similar items. Boxed is growing quickly; revenue doubled last year to more than $100 million and is expected to do the same in 2017. \n  \n But to keep pace with growing demand, the company is starting to automate its fulfillment centers—a move almost guaranteed to spook Boxed's army of pickers, packers and shippers. So far, Huang has managed to automate significant parts of the Union facility, without firing anyone; displaced workers were retrained to use the new technology or given a new job in customer service, say. All the same, Huang was forced to hold multiple meetings to make clear there would be no layoffs. While Boxed kept its word, Mena says a few people still left preemptively. \n  \n Meanwhile back at Boxed’s headquarters in lower Manhattan, Huang has had to justify the policies to his higher-skilled staff. They tend to skew younger and probably won’t take advantage of the wedding and tuition subsidies for years. Moreover, Huang has eschewed the office perks found at most tech startups. (There’s no ping pong table.) His answer to employees who feel they don’t benefit: “If you’re in this company, it’s not about you. It’s actually about us, and the best thing that can happen for us in the long-term is for Boxed to be a success.” |||||\nA summary of this is?", "response": "The article discusses the contrasting approach of Chieh Huang, CEO of New York e-commerce company Boxed, towards his employees compared to other tech entrepreneurs. While tech companies usually provide generous perks to their coders and engineers, gig economy workers such as warehouse employees and drivers often receive low wages and minimal benefits. Huang, however, treats all his employees the same, providing full-time employees with shares in the company, unlimited parental leave, and payment for weddings and college tuition for children, policies that cost tens of thousands of dollars per beneficiary.\n\nHuang's approach stems from his belief in creating a worker-friendly culture and treating warehouse employees with respect and dignity. This approach is aimed at reducing high turnover rates in the warehousing industry, considering that replacing workers can cost up to $28,000 each. Huang's benefits plan is designed to help workers from less privileged backgrounds and retain them as employees for the long term. The impact of a positive company culture on the bottom line is also highlighted, as a stronger company culture leads to more engaged and productive workers, thereby reducing costs associated with employee turnover.\n\nBoxed has managed to grow rapidly, doubling its revenue last year to over $100 million, and its efficient operations have allowed it to offer generous employee packages. However, Boxed is facing challenges as it tries to automate its fulfillment centers to keep up with demand, as automation could potentially threaten the job security of the company's employees.

{"id": "example_10312", "prompt": "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Everyone needs safe drinking water, but about 1.1 billion people have no access to clean water. Most of the world's water is salty ocean water or frozen polar ice. By 2050, the world's population could grow from 6.7 billion to more than 9 billion. All of those people will need water to drink. But the bad news is that some areas of the world are growing drier because of climate change. The total area of the Earth's surface classified  as very dry has doubled since the 1970s. Sadly, the precious resource is still misused in industry, in farming and at homes.  Therefore, the world is facing a crisis over water. \"You do the math, and it gets a little scary,\" says Stuart Minchin, a water expert in Australia. \"We're waking up,\" he says. \"But not fast enough.\"  In southern Australia, farmers have been hit hard. They can't irrigate  their fields well enough. The Australian government has launched a $1.3 billion project to improve Australia's irrigation system to stop the crop production dropping further.  Australians have serious water worries, but it could be worse. They don't have to fear that when they turn on the tap, nothing will come out. That's the case in India. Many people in New Delhi, the capital, go without clean water for days.  City leaders have taken stricter measures to save water. Users pay a very high but affordable price for it. Homeowners who waste water are given large fines. There are 1.9 million people who live in Las Vegas, Nevada. Now it has grown by more than 300,000 people since 2002.

Through these experiences, he gained valuable knowledge and skills that would later contribute to his business endeavors. His unique vision and innovative ideas led him to establish the first-ever mail-order business, Montgomery Ward & Company, in 1872.\n\nDuring his time, retail stores were primarily available in urban areas, making it difficult for rural customers to access goods. Aaron Montgomery Ward recognized this gap in the market and aimed to provide a convenient solution. By creating a mail-order catalog, he brought goods directly to the homes of rural Americans, revolutionizing the retail landscape.\n\nMontgomery Ward's success laid the foundation for future mail-order businesses and transformed the way goods were consumed and distributed across America.

It is located on the east side of the square.\n2. It was built in the early 16th century by Sultan Beyazet II, son of Mehmet the Conqueror.\n\nNow, let's analyze the hypothesis:\n\nThe hypothesis states that the Beyazet Camii on the east side of the square dates back to the 16th century.\n\nComparing the premise and the hypothesis, it becomes apparent that both statements convey similar information. The hypothesis simply condenses the information found in the premise without altering or contradicting anything.\n\nMore specifically, the premise tells us that the Beyazet Camii is on the east side of the square, and the hypothesis reaffirms this by mentioning \"the east side of the square.\"\n\nAdditionally, the premise states that the mosque was built in the early 16th century, and the hypothesis corresponds to this by asserting that it \"dates back to the 16th century.\" While the hypothesis doesn't mention the builder of the mosque or his relation to Mehmet the Conqueror, it does not deny or contradict this information either.\n\nIn summary, the hypothesis is aligned with the premise in terms of both location and time of construction.

While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers.

With a bit of research and some smart decisions, you can achieve a trendy and comfortable look that adheres to your school's dress code. This article will guide you through the essential steps and offer advice for building an efficient wardrobe that proves both stylish and appropriate.\n\nStep 1: Discover Your School's Dress Code\nBefore you start shopping, it's important to understand the specific dress code set by your school. Find out if there are any restrictions or specific requirements that you need to adhere to. This information can usually be found in the school handbook, on the school's website, or by asking a guidance counselor or teacher.\n\nStep 2: Invest in Staple Items\nOnce you know the guidelines, focus on building your wardrobe around a few staple items. A pair of comfortable dress pants and a versatile blazer are essential for any professional wardrobe. These can be mixed and matched with a variety of tops to create different looks that are appropriate for school.\n\nStep 3: Choose Breathable Fabrics\nAs you'll be wearing these clothes for extended periods, it's crucial to opt for breathable and comfortable fabrics. Look for dress shirts and tops made from materials like cotton, linen, or moisture-wicking synthetic blends. These fabrics will help to keep you cool and dry throughout the day.\n\nStep 4: Easy Washing and Cleaning\nSelect clothing that is simple to wash and maintain, as you'll need to keep your professional wardrobe in tip-top condition. Avoid items that require dry cleaning or special care, and instead, go for machine-washable and wrinkle-resistant options.\n\nStep 5: Abide by Modesty Guidelines\nWhile you may see many fashionable and trendy clothing options available, it's critical to keep your school's dress code in mind. Avoid any low cut, skin-revealing, or provocative clothing. Stick to conservative and modest options, as they will ensure that you adhere to the dress code and project a professional image.\n\nStep 6: Opt for Supportive Shoes\nFootwear is often overlooked, but it plays a significant role in your overall comfort and professional appearance. Opt for close-toed shoes with good support, such as loafers, flats, or Oxfords. Avoid high heels, as they can be uncomfortable and cause health issues in the long run. Always consider the school's specific dress code when selecting footwear.\n\nConclusion:\nBuilding a professional wardrobe for school may seem challenging, but by adhering to your institution's dress code and focusing on comfort, you can create an efficient and stylish wardrobe. By following these steps and prioritizing investable staple items, breathable fabrics, easy-to-clean clothes, modesty, and supportive shoes, you'll be ready to tackle any school day feeling confident and comfortable in your professional attire.", "token_count": 512}

This outcome is highly likely if the group lacks empathy and critical thinking skills.\n\nOutcome 2: Attempts to change the other person's opinion\n- They could try to persuade others to adopt their beliefs, using various tactics such as peer pressure or manipulation. This outcome is probable if the group is motivated and passionate about their opinions but lacks the ability to engage in open and respectful conversations.\n\nOutcome 3: Creation of an echo chamber\n- The group may opt to only interact with like-minded individuals or avoid exposing themselves to different opinions altogether. This outcome is possible if the group is uncomfortable with cognitive dissonance and prefers to remain in an environment where their beliefs are constantly reinforced.\n\nOutcome 4: Development of negative biases towards people with different opinions\n- The group may generalize and label people with differing opinions as \"evil\" or \"inferior,\" promoting prejudiced mindsets. This outcome is plausible if the group heavily bases their self-identity on their opinions and views others as threats to their self-worth.\n\nOutcome 5: Compartmentalizing of relationships\n- They could still maintain connections with people who have different opinions but choose to avoid discussing sensitive or controversial topics with them.

These outcomes range from conflicts and negative biases to compartmentalizing relationships and creating echo chambers. The likelihood of each outcome will depend on the specific characteristics and priorities of the group in question.", "token_count": 512}

Kvitøya was usually inaccessible to the sealing or whaling ships of the time, as it is typically surrounded by a wide belt of thick polar ice and often hidden by thick ice fogs. However, summer in 1930 had been particularly warm, and the surrounding sea was practically free of ice. As Kvitøya was known to be a prime hunting ground for walrus and the fogs over the island on that day were comparatively thin, some of the crew of the Bratvaag took this rare opportunity to land on what they called the \"inaccessible island\".Two of the sealers in search of water, Olav Salen and Karl Tusvick, discovered Andrée's boat near a small stream, frozen under a mound of snow and full of equipment, including a boathook engraved with the words \"Andrée's Polar Expedition, 1896\". Presented with this hook, the Bratvaag's captain, Peder Eliassen, assigned the crew to search the site together with the expedition members. Among other finds, they uncovered a journal and two skeletons, identified as Andrée's and Strindberg's remains by monograms found on their clothing.The Bratvaag left the island to continue its scheduled hunting and observations, with the intent of coming back later to see if the ice had melted further and uncovered more artifacts. Further discoveries were made by the M/K Isbjørn of Tromsø, a sealing sloop chartered by news reporters to waylay the Bratvaag. Unsuccessful in this, the reporters and the Isbjørn crew made instead for Kvitøya, landing on the island on 5 September in fine weather and finding even less ice than the Bratvaag had. After photographing the area, they searched for and found Frænkel's body, and additional artifacts, including a tin box containing Strindberg's photographic film, his logbook, and maps.

{"id": "example_11788", "prompt": "How would someone go about accomplishing this goal?\nTo brown butter", "response": "Browning butter is a simple, yet transformative process that unlocks intense nutty and complex flavors from regular unsalted butter. When done right, brown butter can elevate various dishes, from sautés and pasta sauces to cookies and brownies. Here's a detailed guide to help you achieve perfectly browned butter:\n\n1. Choose the right butter: It is essential to start with good-quality unsalted butter since the flavor of the final product greatly depends on it. Lower-quality butter might contain more water, which can affect the browning process. Unsalted butter is preferred as it allows you to control the salt content of your dish.\n\n2. Prepare the tools: For optimal results, you'll need a light-colored pan with a heavy bottom, like stainless steel or enameled cast iron. The lighter color allows you to monitor the color change more easily, avoiding burning. Additionally, the thick bottom conducts heat more evenly, preventing the butter from scorching. You will also need a heat-resistant spatula or a wooden spoon for stirring and a bowl to collect the browned butter.\n\n3. Cut the butter into small pieces: This ensures that the butter melts evenly and more quickly. It'll also help you to monitor the browning more effectively.\n\n4. Heat the pan: Place the pan on the stove over medium heat and let it get warm.\n\n5. Melt the butter: Add the butter to the pan and stir gently to promote even melting. Make sure to scrape the bottom and sides to prevent any butter from sticking and brown spots from forming.\n\n6. Monitor the stages: Keep an eye on the color change and listen to the changes in sizzling sounds. It will go through three main phases:\n\n   a. Foaming: In this first stage, the butter will foam up as the water content starts to evaporate. The sizzling will get louder and the foam will rise. Keep stirring, watching, and listening.\n\n   b. Subsiding foam: The foam will begin to subside and the butter will start to smell nutty. At this point, the milk solids will separate and sink to the bottom, so keep stirring to prevent them from burning.\n\n   c. Browning: The butter will reach a golden brown color, and the milk solids at the bottom will turn brown as well. The sizzling sound will subside, indicating that most of the water content has evaporated.\n\n7. Keep a watchful eye: This is the critical stage when the milk solids can easily go from browned to burned. Make sure not to walk away and pay close attention to the smell, color, and sound.\n\n8. Remove the pan from heat: As soon as the butter reaches a deep golden brown color and has a fragrant nutty smell, remove the pan from the heat. The residual heat will continue to cook the milk solids in the pan, so it is essential to remove it from the heat source at the right time.\n\n9. Pour the browned butter into a bowl: To stop the cooking process and prevent the brown butter from burning, transfer it immediately to a heatproof bowl using the spatula or spoon to scrape every last bit.\n\n10. Cool and store: Let the brown butter cool down before using it in your recipes. You can store it at room temperature for up to a week or refrigerate it in an airtight container for up to a month. If refrigerated, it will solidify and require gentle reheating before using it in your dishes.\n\nBy following these steps and paying attention to the visual and audible cues, you'll be able to master the art of browning butter, which is sure to indulge your senses and enhance your culinary creations.", "token_count": 512}
{"id": "example_904", "prompt": "What's an example of a movie review?", "response": "Title: Christopher Nolan's \"Inception\" \n\n\"Inception\" is an inventive, mesmerizing, metaphysical heist film by the mastermind filmmaker Christopher Nolan, a truly compelling and cerebral cinematic experience that boggles the mind while also igniting the imagination. It boasts of an intricately dense and thought-provoking plot, with all the wayward nuances and sub-structures layered seamlessly to concoct an all-encompassing journey through dreams within dreams.\n\nNolan provides audiences with staggering visuals and an enthralling plot, craftily designed to keep the viewer glued to their seats, parsing through the myriad of twists and spirals he weaves onto the silver screen. An ensemble cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, and Ellen Page, take the performances to the next level. Their strong performances are a beacon guiding the audience through the intricate maze that is the narrative.\n\nDiCaprio, in the role of Dominick Cobb – a thief of the subconscious, is an engrossing protagonist with many layers of complexity. As an extractor who invades people's dreams to manipulate their thoughts, he delivers a strongly grounded performance and brings enforced credibility to the character.\n\nMoreover, the technical elements are nothing short of incredibly stunning. Wally Pfister's cinematography is pristine and monumental. The cityscape folding scene is a visual spectacle that is a testament to Paul J. Franklin's special effects team. Hans Zimmer’s emotionally charged, pulse-pounding score only intensifies the effect, amplifying the action sequences and bringing extra depth to the more emotional scenes.\n\nThat said, \"Inception\" is not an easy watch and certainly not for the more casual moviegoer. Its complexity, while a selling point for some, can be a pitfall for others. The movie demands full attention and even multiple viewings to fully grasp its narrative intricacies. Yet, it is through such complexity that \"Inception\" captures its charm, never talking down to its audience and delivering a storyline that is nothing short of a puzzle, waiting to be adoringly put together by the viewer.\n\nHowever, one might find some emotional disconnect, especially given the heavy focus on the conceptual technicalities. Additionally, while the ensemble cast does perform admirably throughout the movie, some characters lack significant development and depth outside their roles in said heist.\n\nNolan presents a fascinating concept and constructs it admirably, providing just enough information for the audience to piece the puzzle together while still leaving spaces for interpretation. \"Inception\" is a daring, ambitious piece of filmmaking, the kind of cinema that challenges and engages its audience, keeping them thinking long after the credits roll. It is a testament to Nolan's ability as a writer and director that he has managed to craft a film that is as intellectually challenging as it is emotionally enthralling.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Inception\" is a spectacular, thought-provoking film that offers one of the most unique and captivating narratives in recent cinema history. It's visually striking, conceptually substantial, and rewards viewers for their investment. Despite a few minor pitfalls, it is an unforgettable mind-bending masterpiece of filmmaking that dares to dream bigger than most films dare to do. I rate it 4.5 out of 5 stars, and it comes highly recommended for those who appreciate cinema that challenges the mind while touching the heart.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_3164", "prompt": "A boy band (or boyband) is loosely defined as a vocal group consisting of young male singers, usually in their teenage years or in their twenties at the time of formation, singing love songs marketed towards young women. Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play musical instruments, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term something of a misnomer. However, exceptions do exist. Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances.\n\nThe earliest forerunner of boy band music began in the late 19th century as a cappella barbershop quartets. They were usually a group of males and sang in four-part harmonies. Barbershop quartets were popular into the earlier part of the 20th century. A revival of the male vocal group took place in the late 1940s and 1950s with the use of doo-wop music. Doo-wop bands sang about topics such as love and other themes used in pop music. The earliest traces of boy bands were in the mid-1950s although the term boy band was not used. African American vocal group The Ink Spots was one of the first of what would now be called boy bands. The term boy band was not established until the late 1980s as before that they were called male vocal groups or \"hep harmony singing groups\".  Although generally described as a rock band, the highest-selling band in history The Beatles are considered by a number or journalists \"the first\" or \"the original\" boyband, \"before anyone had thought of the term.\"  The Liverpool quartet known as The Beatles were not only the quintessential rock band, but many considered John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Star to be the original boy band -- especially in the early 1960s when young girls would scream at the top of their lungs and pass out upon first sight of the \"Fab Four.  The Beatles inspired the decision to produce the 1966 television series The Monkees, which spawned the music group of the same name, formed by the four starring actors.

Almost as soon as they returned home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. \"Christianity will go,\" Lennon had said. \"It will vanish and shrink.

The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, \"If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.\" Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: \"If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry.\"As preparations were made for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard.

The Texans began their season with a home game against the Indianapolis Colts, a division rival in which they had only beaten once ever. However, Houston got off to an early 13-0 lead after 30 and 49-yard field goals from Neil Rackers (who had recently replaced Kris Brown as the team's kicker) and a 22-yard touchdown pass from Matt Schaub, leading passer in the league a year ago, to Kevin Walter. As expected, the Colts wouldn't go down without a fight as Indy scored ten unanswered points to close out the half on a 14-yard touchdown pass from Peyton Manning to Reggie Wayne and a 20-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri. With the momentum seemingly shifting to Indianapolis, Houston took nearly eight minutes off the third-quarter clock with a 15-play drive (13 rushes) out of the locker room, as Arian Foster scored from a yard out, his first of three touchdowns on the day. Going into the fourth with Houston leading 20-10, the Texans continued to run, and the Colts continued to pass, as Peyton Manning attempted 57 passes that day, completing 40, a career-high. However, it wouldn't be enough; even though the Colts scored two touchdowns on a 10-yard pass to Dallas Clark and a 73-yard pass to Austin Collie, the Texans would score two of their own: 25 and 8-yard runs from Arian Foster en route to a 34-24 Houston win at Reliant Stadium. Arian Foster finished with 231 rushing yards on 33 carries. Both were Houston records for a game, and the 231 yards was the second most rushing yards on opening week, only behind O.J. Simpson. Peyton Manning eventually went 40/57 for 433 yards and three touchdowns. Houston began the season 1-0 and won for only the second time against Indianapolis, against fifteen losses.

The community is home to the Immaculate Conception Ukrainian Catholic Church which is an intricately designed structure featuring nine cupolas and built almost entirely with volunteer labour . The church was built in 1923 . There is also another church , called St. Michael 's and Sacred Heart in town which is in the same property as the Cooks Creek Heritage Museum .  - Birds Hill Provincial Park is a provincial park in Manitoba, Canada. It is located 24 kilometres north of Winnipeg on Highway 59, and covers approximately 8300 acres (35.1 square kilometres). The area (and park) is named after Dr. Curtis Bird, first speaker of the Manitoba provincial legislature in 1873, whose father had been a factor in the Hudson's Bay Company and received a large land grant at this location. Since the area is higher than the surrounding terrain, what is now Birds Hill Park served early settlers as a refuge from flooding in the years 1826 and 1852. It is part of the RM of Springfield, with a relatively small portion lying within the Rural Municipality of St. Clements. The provincial park features a mixture of aspen and oak forest with open prairie/savannah, spruce, bog areas and mixed boreal forest communities, not commonly found so close together.  - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \"town\" varies considerably in different parts of the world.  - The R.M. of Springfield was incorporated in 1880 as a result of changes made to the R.M. of Springfield and Sunnyside (1873-1880). The municipality received its name due to the presence of multiple natural springs found within its borders. Springfield stretches from urban industrial development on the eastern boundary of the City of Winnipeg, through urban, rural residential, agricultural and natural landscapes, to the Agassiz Provincial Forest on the municipality's eastern boundary. Birds Hill Provincial Park nestles into the northwestern corner of Springfield. While farming is still important in the municipality, today many residents are employed in nearby Winnipeg. In the 2011 census the population was 14,069, up 8.3% from 2006.  - A community is commonly considered a social unit (a group of people) who have something in common, such as norms, values, or identity. Often - but not always - communities share a sense of place that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood). Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community. People tend to define those social ties as important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions like family, home, work, government, society, or humanity, at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties (micro-level), \"community\" may also refer to large group affiliations (or macro-level), such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities.  - A post office is a customer service facility forming part of a national postal system. Post offices offer mail-related services such as acceptance of letters and parcels; provision of post office boxes; and sale of postage stamps, packaging, and stationery.

{"id": "example_12787", "prompt": "Given the question: While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred.  The explorers visited Galapagos 1 and Galapagos 2, both islands part of the same archipelago. Island 1 had experienced a drought in recent years. Both islands had populations of birds living there.  Which island had fewer small-beaked birds that could only crack open smaller seeds?\nThe answer is:", "response": "Island 1\n\nStep 1: Understand the context given in the question:\n- The Grants were on the Galapagos\n- A drought occurred, resulting in fewer seeds for finches to eat\n- Birds with smaller beaks could only eat smaller seeds, while birds with bigger beaks could eat all sizes of seeds\n- Many small-beaked birds died during the drought, and big-beaked birds survived and reproduced, increasing the average beak size in the population\n- Evolution by natural selection had occurred\n- The explorers visited Island 1 (which experienced a drought) and Island 2 (no indication of a drought)\n\nStep 2: Identify the relationship between the drought and bird beak sizes:\n- The drought resulted in fewer seeds\n- As a consequence, small-beaked birds struggled to survive and many of them died\n\nStep 3: Compare Islands 1 and 2:\n- Island 1 experienced a drought, which affected the bird population by favoring birds with bigger beaks\n- Island 2 had no indication of a drought, and thus we can assume the small-beaked bird population was not affected in the same way as on Island 1\n\nStep 4: Determine which island had fewer small-beaked birds:\n- Since the drought on Island 1 resulted in the death of many small-beaked birds and an increase in the average beak size of the surviving bird population, we can conclude that Island 1 had fewer small-beaked birds that could only crack open smaller seeds.", "token_count": 501}

This is in line with the priorities of the European Commission's communication, which emphasizes improving the mutual understanding, trust, and overall effectiveness of the justice and home affairs systems within the EU.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we will work closely with all EU member states, European Union institutions, and relevant stakeholders to create an effective, transparent, and robust evaluation mechanism for justice and home affairs. This evaluation system will be designed to identify best practices, detect weaknesses, and address emerging challenges in the field.\n\nIn order to develop this evaluation system, our presidency has identified several key areas that we will focus on:\n\n1. Strengthening the rule of law: We will prioritize efforts to maintain and enhance the rule of law within the European Union, including exploring ways to better monitor and assess the state of rule of law in member states. This will involve working with relevant stakeholders and institutions to create harmonized criteria, indicators, and mechanisms for evaluation.\n\n2. Enhancing judicial cooperation: We aim to improve the efficiency of cross-border cooperation in judicial matters among EU member states, including exploring ways to streamline the exchange of information and increase the use of digital tools. Additionally, we will promote the adoption of integrated case management systems for better communication and information sharing among judicial authorities.\n\n3. Improving the fight against organized crime and terrorism: We will promote the development of common strategies, policies, and legislative frameworks to tackle organized crime and terrorism more effectively. This will involve strengthening cooperation with Europol, Eurojust, and other relevant agencies, as well as working together with member states to improve the exchange of information, intelligence, and best practices.\n\n4. Enhancing migration and asylum policies: We will focus on promoting a common European approach to migration and asylum policies, including the development of coherent and effective evaluation mechanisms. These mechanisms will consider the integration of migrants into society, the respect for human rights, and cooperation with third countries to address the root causes of migration.\n\n5. Promoting civil protection and crisis management: We will work to enhance the EU’s capacity to respond to crises and emergencies, including the development of an integrated assessment framework for civil protection and crisis management. This framework will enable member states and EU institutions to evaluate and monitor their preparedness and response capabilities effectively, ensuring that the EU remains resilient in the face of future challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, our presidency will focus on developing comprehensive evaluation systems for justice and home affairs that closely align with the European Commission's communication.

Identify the sections: \n    - Look at the string and identify the different sections where separate words or sentences are seen. In this case, the sections are: \"The\", \"formula\", \"in\", \"B2\", \"is\", \"=\", \"2×A2\", \"+\", \"4\", \"which\", \"is\", \"copied\", \"down\".\n\n2. Add spaces between sections:\n    - After identifying the sections, add a space between these sections to make them look like separate words or phrases. This would transform the string into: \"The formula in B2 is = 2×A2 + 4 which is copied down.\"\n\nThis process is based on my internal knowledge of English words and how Excel formulas are typically written. For non-English phrases, names, or more complex Excel formulas, more context or a different process might be needed. However, for this task, this approach delivers a correctly spaced phrase: \"The formula in B2 is = 2×A2 + 4 which is copied down.\"", "token_count": 263}

{"id": "example_5236", "prompt": "The tourist village had two beaches: Coral beach with nice sand and deeper water was preferred by families, and Surfer beach which  had shallow water was a surfer's heaven.  Which beach was less suitable for surfing and windsurfing?  Hint: When wind waves approach to coast area from deep water, the waves change their heights and lengths. The wave height becomes higher and the wavelength becomes shorter as the wave velocity is slowed when ocean waves approach to the shore. If the water depth is sufficiently shallow, the wave crest become steeper and the trough gets broader and shallower; finally, the ocean waves break at the shore. The motions of wave breaking are different with along to the steepness of shores and waves, and can be categorized by below three types.[11][12]\nAnswer:", "response": "Based on the information provided, the Coral beach with nice sand and deeper water is less suitable for surfing and windsurfing compared to Surfer beach, which has shallow water.\n\nThe wave characteristics play a crucial role in determining the suitability of a beach for surfing and windsurfing. As ocean waves approach the shore, the waves change their heights and lengths due to the slowing of wave velocity. The wave height becomes higher and the wavelength becomes shorter. If the water depth is sufficiently shallow, the wave crest becomes steeper and the trough gets broader and shallower, eventually causing the ocean waves to break at the shore. The motions of wave breaking vary depending on the steepness of the shores and the waves, and can be categorized into three main types.\n\nIn the case of Coral beach, the deeper water makes it less ideal for surfing and windsurfing. The deep water doesn't allow the waves to develop the necessary steepness and breaking motions that are conducive to surfing or windsurfing activities as the waves may not slow down enough or break properly near the shore. It does, however, make the beach a more desirable destination for families as they can enjoy swimming and playing in the sand without worrying about strong waves.\n\nOn the other hand, Surfer beach offers shallow water, which is more suitable for surfing and windsurfing. The shallow water allows the waves to slow down and break near the shore, creating steeper crests and broader, shallower troughs that facilitate surfing and windsurfing. The wave characteristics provided by the shallow water and the breaking motions of the waves make Surfer beach the preferred location for surfers.\n\nOverall, Surfer beach is more suitable for surfing and windsurfing due to its shallow water, which results in the desirable wave characteristics necessary for these activities. In contrast, the deep water at Coral beach makes it less ideal for surfing and windsurfing but more appropriate for family-oriented activities such as swimming and beach play.", "token_count": 512}

Known for his original and groundbreaking works in film, Tarantino was quick to take action, filing a lawsuit against the website in question. However, the judge recently ruled in favor of Tarantino, stating that he did not show evidence of a copyright infringement. Despite this setback, Tarantino is reportedly revising the script and considering moving forward with the production of the film.\n\nThe leak of the unproduced movie script initially caused a stir among fans and industry insiders alike, who eagerly awaited the latest project from the mastermind behind award-winning films like Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained. The legal battle that ensued was closely followed by those invested in Tarantino's work and the issue of intellectual property rights.\n\nMatters of copyright and intellectual property have been at the forefront of the entertainment industry for decades, only growing more complex in the digital age, with easier access to more information and the ever-present risk of leaks. With Tarantino's case making headlines, it has once again brought the discussion of copyright infringement and creative rights to the forefront of the industry's ongoing conversations and legal battles.\n\nDespite the judge's ruling, Quentin Tarantino remains undeterred, reportedly working on revisions to the script in question. This suggests that, despite what might be considered a legal loss, the famed director remains undaunted and continues to focus on his craft. While there is no confirmation as to whether the project will indeed move forward to become a film, fans of the iconic director and screenwriter will no doubt be eagerly awaiting any news on the development of this script.\n\nIn conclusion, the legal battle over Tarantino's unproduced movie script highlights the ongoing concerns surrounding intellectual property rights and copyright infringement in the entertainment industry. As Tarantino revises the leaked script, the possibility of a new film from the acclaimed director remains on the horizon, illustrating that while the legal landscape may be complicated, creativity and artistry can still find a way to flourish.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_590", "prompt": "Generate a correctly punctuated version of the following text: The busiest beach is Playa de Alcudia which is located close to the largest holiday resort in Mallorca Port dAlcudia This is a family favourite with its calm and shallow water", "response": "Here is the correctly punctuated version of the text:\n\n\"The busiest beach is Playa de Alcudia, which is located close to the largest holiday resort in Mallorca, Port d'Alcudia. This is a family favourite with its calm and shallow water.\"\n\nJustification of steps:\n\n1. I identified the sentences in the provided text. There are two sentences - one about 'Playa de Alcudia' and the other about why it is a family favourite. So, I put a period (.) after 'Port d'Alcudia' to distinguish between these two sentences.\n\n2. Next, I identified the clauses in the sentences. There are two non-restrictive relative clauses ('which is located close to the largest holiday resort in Mallorca' and 'which is a family favourite with its calm and shallow water') that provide additional information about 'Playa de Alcudia'. In English grammar, nonrestrictive relative clauses are usually demarcated by commas (,), so I added commas before 'which' in both sentences.\n\n3. Lastly, I noticed the term \"Port d'Alcudia\", in which 'd' must be an abbreviated form of 'de', representing the preposition 'of'. It's common to use an apostrophe (') to denote such abbreviations; therefore, I replaced 'd' with 'd''. This is to ensure that the abbreviation is in line with the rules of English punctuation.", "token_count": 369}

{"id": "example_821", "prompt": "Q:The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer. If yes, write \"True\", otherwise write \"False\". Question: how did j.p morgan become a wealthy man? Suggestion: In 1892 Morgan arranged the merger of Edison General Electric and Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric .\nA:", "response": "While the suggested answer does touch upon one of the significant business deals that contributed to J.P. Morgan's wealth, it does not provide a comprehensive view of how he became a wealthy man. For a more detailed and long answer, we must consider various aspects of J.P. Morgan's life and career.\n\nJohn Pierpont Morgan, or J.P. Morgan, was born in 1837 to a prosperous family with a history of successful involvement in merchant banking. He was educated in elite schools in Europe, which gave him exposure to global finance and business. He began his career in banking by working with his father, Junius Spencer Morgan, who was already a successful merchant banker.\n\nMorgan's rise to wealth can largely be attributed to his innovative thinking, business strategies, and his ability to identify opportunities in various industries. His wealth accumulation journey can be summarized through a series of key events and investments:\n\n1. Early Investments: In the 1860s and 1870s, Morgan invested in a wide range of industries, including railroads, steel, and manufacturing. These investments laid the foundation for his wealth.\n\n2. Taking over Drexel, Morgan & Co: In 1871, Morgan joined forces with Anthony Drexel, a Philadelphia financier, to create the banking firm Drexel, Morgan & Co. The firm later became J.P. Morgan & Co., allowing Morgan to expand his influence and wealth in the financial sector.\n\n3. Railroad Investments: Morgan became known as a powerhouse in the railroad industry, playing a crucial role in the reorganization of troubled railroads and introducing innovative financial strategies for their consolidation and growth. His involvement in the railroad industry significantly increased his wealth.\n\n4. The 1892 Merger: As suggested in the original answer, he played a pivotal role in the merger of Edison General Electric and Thomson-Houston Electric Company, which led to the creation of General Electric. This was a landmark business deal that augmented his wealth and solidified his status as a financial titan.\n\n5. Formation of U.S. Steel Corporation: In 1901, Morgan spearheaded the largest-ever merger at the time, whereby he consolidated multiple steel companies, including Carnegie Steel, into the U.S. Steel Corporation. This deal further added to his wealth and influence in various industries.\n\n6. Financial Savior during Panic of 1907: J.P. Morgan's strategic efforts to alleviate the Panic of 1907, orchestrating bailouts and financing banks, cemented his position as a major figure in American finance and indirectly contributed to his wealth.\n\nThus, it would be 'False' to accept the proposed suggestion as the sole reason for J.P. Morgan's wealth. Instead, it is due to a combination of strategic investments, mergers, and his financial prowess across multiple industries during his lifetime that led to J.P. Morgan becoming one of the wealthiest men in history.", "token_count": 512}

As the elders render a guilty verdict, Zod notes that the verdict must be unanimous, so Jor-El ultimately holds the key to their fate. Despite his disillusionment with the Council of Elders, Jor-El renders a conviction. The vast dome of the planet's capital city opens to the night, and a small extra-dimensional prison - the Phantom Zone - tumbles out of the sky and pulls the three criminals out of the trial room and into an eternity in dimensional limbo through space. While a frightened Ursa begs for forgiveness, Zod defiantly swears that he will have his vengeance on the House of El, even if it takes him a thousand years.However, Jor-El's more pressing concern lies in the orbital shift of Krypton; this shift is putting the planet into the fatal gravitational pull of its central star, a fact blithely ignored by the Council Of Elders. The leader of the Council forbids Jor-El from warning the larger populace or he will be imprisoned in the Phantom Zone...\nA:", "response": "Insufficient information to provide an answer.", "token_count": 506}

{"id": "example_11144", "prompt": "Please answer the following question: Article: Today Newtown is a very clean place. But many years ago, there were millions of rats in Newtown. They attacked  the cats and dogs. Sometimes a lot of them knocked down a man or woman walking home at night. The rats were very big in size and they hurt many people. The government   ordered   everybody to kill rats. Most people were lazy, so they did not kill many. Then the government decided to pay some money for each dead rat. That made the people very happy. They killed thousands of rats every day. A government officer put all the dead rats in a big pile . Sometimes a man brought hundreds in one day. After two weeks there were not many rats in the city, but people still brought many rats to the government office. The government officer thought that people were stealing   dead rats from the pile. He ordered his men to dig a deep hole and put the rats in it. Soon there were no more rats, and the government did not pay any more money. Question: Which of the following is the best title   for this passage Yes or no, is the answer \"How Newtown Became a Very Clean Place\"?\nA:", "response": "Yes, the answer \"How Newtown Became a Very Clean Place\" is the best title for this passage.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: scare people into following his specific laws  B: become a dictator  C: give people a better future and world to live in\nA:", "response": "Answer A: scare people into following his specific laws best answers the question according to the context.\n\nIn the given context, Alex is portrayed as governing each person with an iron fist and an irrational justice system. This style of leadership is far from being just or focused on creating a better future for the people, as suggested by Option C. The line \"irrational justice system\" implies that laws and punishments are enforced without discernment, to the point of unfairness. This kind of approach to leadership is more likely intended to instill fear in citizens, making them follow the specific laws imposed by Alex out of terror rather than genuine acceptance or understanding.\n\nAnswer B mentions becoming a dictator, but the context already implies that Alex is a dictator. Hence, it does not accurately answer the question of why Alex chose this harsh governing method. The passage states that Alex governs \"with an iron fist,\" a phrase often associated with dictatorial rule. The key is to focus on the reason for his choice or actions as a dictator.\n\nTherefore, based on the context provided, Answer A: scare people into following his specific laws, is the best answer since it captures the essence of ruling with fear and is closely aligned to the information given.

The tragic incident has left several families shattered while raising significant concerns about safety measures and infrastructural conditions in the region. In this article, we take a closer look at the causes of the explosion, its possible repercussions, and the need for reassessment of safety protocols.\n\nThe Explosion: What Happened\n\nThe massive explosion occurred in a gas pipeline running through the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, a densely populated region of India known for its agricultural contributions and industrial areas. The precise cause of the explosion has not yet been confirmed. Still, preliminary investigations suggest that it could be attributed to a technical failure or a possible leak in the pipeline.\n\nThe explosion had severe consequences; the impact of the blast demolished several houses, engulfed nearby vegetation in flames, and caused panic among residents. The intensity of the explosion left at least 14 people dead and several others injured. Local authorities and emergency services rushed to the area to conduct rescue operations, tend to the injured, and search for any remaining survivors.\n\nRepercussions of the Tragedy\n\nResidents in the affected areas have been left in a state of shock, as the explosion has claimed the lives of family members and friends or caused severe injury. The regional government will likely face public outcry, demanding answers and seeking immediate action. Furthermore, the incident may lead to public backlash against the state-owned gas company operating the pipeline, posing questions about the safety and maintenance of their infrastructure.\n\nThe government may also face allegations of negligence and lack of oversight, as they are responsible for ensuring regular safety checks and monitoring of infrastructure projects, especially those involving hazardous materials such as natural gas. The incident, therefore, raises significant questions about the existing regulatory framework and its effectiveness in preventing such accidents in India.\n\nA Wake-up Call for Assessing Safety Measures\n\nThe unfortunate incident in Andhra Pradesh serves as a wake-up call for regulatory authorities across India that the current safety and monitoring protocols might be insufficient to ensure the security and integrity of vital infrastructure facilities. There is an urgent need for a thorough review of the current safety measures and the implementation of stricter guidelines to prevent such disasters from occurring in the future.\n\nKey areas for improvement include:\n\n1. Regular Routine Inspections: Ensuring that pipelines undergo regular, comprehensive checks for any signs of damage or wear. This also entails a strict monitoring of the repairs and maintenance conducted in case of any identified issues.\n\n2. Advanced Leak Detection Systems: Investing in the development and integration of advanced leak detection systems, accompanied by emergency shutdown mechanisms, to minimize the risk of accidents tied to gas leaks.\n\n3. Enhanced Regulatory Framework: Implementing a more stringent regulatory framework with clearly-defined responsibilities for the companies and authorities involved in the pipeline operations. Failure to comply should be met with serious sanctions and penalties.\n\n4. Community Preparedness Programs: Educating local communities living near pipelines or other hazardous infrastructures about the potential risks and the necessary precautions to take in case of an emergency. This will enable them to play a proactive role in preventing disasters and reacting effectively during dire situations.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe tragic gas pipeline explosion in Andhra Pradesh is an unfortunate reminder of the potential risks and devastating consequences tied to inadequate safety measures of hazardous infrastructures. It is crucial for the Indian government, regulatory authorities, and companies involved in such projects to learn from these incidents and implement robust safety protocols and monitoring systems in order to prevent such disasters in the future and safeguard the lives of citizens.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_5219", "prompt": "You are given a new situation: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.  and a hint : In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.  Please answer this question : Which crop would be less beneficial to farmers, crop A or crop B?\nThe answer to this question is:", "response": "Crop B would be less beneficial to farmers. \n\nThe main reason for this lies in the nature of crop B as explained in the situation above. Unlike crop A, crop B is not tolerant to herbicides. Consequently, utilizing traditional methods such as herbicides to control weeds could negatively impact crop B's yield and quality. This is because these chemicals, while designed to destroy weeds, can also damage crops that have not been genetically engineered to resist them.\n\nWeeds are a constant problem for farmers and gardeners, as they compete with crops for essential resources such as water and nutrients. Hence, effective weed management is essential for successful agriculture. In the absence of a herbicide tolerance, a farmer growing crop B would likely have to resort to using time-consuming and labor-intensive manual methods like mechanical or hand weeding to control the weed population. This not only results in additional costs in terms of time and labor, but it is also less efficient and may disrupt the growth of the crops.\n\nOn the other hand, crop A, which has been genetically engineered to be herbicide tolerant, would significantly reduce these challenges. This modification would allow farmers to effectively use herbicides for weed control without causing collateral damage to the crop. Lesser chemical applications mean reduced costs and potential environmental impacts. The probable yield from crop A would likely be higher because the crop is not being damaged by weed competition or by the measures used to control weeds.\n\nIn conclusion, crop A's herbicide tolerance represents a significant advantage for farmers seeking to improve their weed management practices and increase yield. Consequently, crop B, lacking this tolerance and therefore being more susceptible to herbicide damage and weed competition, would indeed be less beneficial to farmers.", "token_count": 512}

The primary source of income for the townspeople is the old sawmill, owned and operated by the local prominent farmer, Charles McIntyre, and his wife, Eliza McIntyre. Eliza had been a city girl and journalist who decided to start a new life in the countryside with her husband. Their love story is well-known and admired by the townspeople, but whispers of hidden secrets and discontent in their marriage have started to circulate.\n\nCharles, burdened by a familial predisposition to drinking, often disappears and indulges in alcohol. In contrast, Eliza remains compassionate and throws herself into her charity work and other activities to help the town prosper. Despite her husband's failings, Eliza is loved and respected by the community.\n\nAct II:\n\nOne day, Eliza receives a letter from an anonymous source, hinting that the town's sawmill rests on a dark, untold secret. Intrigued, she decides to investigate and starts by researching the sawmill's history. Her journalistic instincts come alive, and she begins interviewing elderly townspeople to collect any relevant information.\n\nThrough the interviews, Eliza discovers the town was founded on the booming lumber business but goes through cycles of enrichment and impoverishment. Legend has it that the sawmill is cursed, as a terrible tragedy occurs every few decades, leading to the closing of the sawmill for a time.\n\nUnsatisfied with the information and disbelieving of curses, Eliza decides to unravel the mysteries of the sawmill itself. One evening, while her husband is out, she sneaks into the sawmill to continue her investigations. As she explores the building, she comes across a hidden room with rotten floorboards. Carefully, she walks towards the room when suddenly, the floorboards give in, plunging her into the abyss below.\n\nAct III:\n\nThe townspeople are shocked to discover Eliza's lifeless body the next morning.

A bright and determined city detective, Sarah, is dispatched to Millwood to assist in the investigation.\n\nAs Sarah and Charles follow Eliza's clues, they unearth long-forgotten documents that reveal a dark history surrounding the sawmill's construction. The sawmill, it turns out, was built on an ancient burial ground. The townspeople, desperate to attract wealth and prosperity, made a pact with a malicious spirit residing in the burial ground. Every few decades, a member of the community vanishes without a trace, and in return, the town prospers, and the sawmill continues to operate.\n\nThe community tries to keep this truth hidden, stubbornly sticking to assumptions of a natural accidental death. Together, Sarah and Charles work through obstacles and threats from the shadowy town council, determined to expose the truth and break the town's deadly pact.\n\nIn the climax, they perform a ritual involving Eliza's spirit to cleanse the curse and confront the malicious spirit. With Eliza's aid and the reluctant support of the townspeople, the curse is lifted, resulting in the closure of the sawmill.\n\nIn the aftermath, the town of Millwood starts rebuilding its future, and its residents confront their morally fraught legacy.

{"id": "example_11521", "prompt": "Answer by taking a quote from the following article:\n\nAlejo Carpentier y Valmont (December 26, 1904 - April 24, 1980) was a Cuban novelist, essayist, and musicologist who greatly influenced Latin American literature during its famous \"boom\" period. Born in Lausanne, Switzerland, Carpentier grew up in Havana, Cuba, and despite his European birthplace, he strongly self-identified as Cuban throughout his life. He traveled extensively, particularly in France, and to South America and Mexico, where he met prominent members of the Latin American cultural and artistic community. Carpentier took a keen interest in Latin American politics and often aligned himself with revolutionary movements, such as Fidel Castro's Communist Revolution in Cuba in the mid-20th century.\n\nAs a young child Carpentier was exposed to a great deal of music. Carpentier himself played the piano, as did his mother; his father played cello, studying under Pablo Casals, and his grandmother played the organ. Carpentier studied music theory at the Lycee Jeanson de Sailly when he lived in Paris for the first time. Carpentier's own compositions made him an important part of the contemporary Cuban musical landscape, but he also studied the origins and political nuances of Cuban music. His devotion to the adaptations of European artistic styles into Latin American music styles can also be seen in his admiration for Afro-Cuban musical themes.  Early in his career Carpentier collaborated with other young musicians eager to explore Cuban musical roots. One such collaborator was Amadeo Roldan, a French musician of Cuban background. They helped to organize the Cuban premiere of popular orchestral music of the era Conciertos de musica nueva (Concerts of New Music), featuring composers such as Stravinsky, Milhaud, Ravel, Malipiero, Poulenc and Erik Satie. In regards to their own music, Carpentier and Roldan were far more interested in integrating African rhythms and melodies into their works and abandoned imitation of European musical styles. \"!Abajo la lira, arriba el bongo!\" (Down with the lyre, up with the bongo!) was the popular slogan for their style of music. Carpentier and Roldan collaborated on numerous works, including the 1925 orchestral piece Obertura sobre temas cubanos (Overture on Cuban Themes) which was regarded as scandalous for its betrayal of what was seen as the proper European-style symphony in favor of Afro-Cuban inspired music. Other well-known collaborations between the two included Tres pequenas poemas: Oriente, Pregon, Fiesta negra (Three little poems) produced in 1926, and two Afro-Cuban ballets: La Rebambaramba, a colonial ballet in two parts (1928) and El milagro de Anaquille (1929).  Carpentier's interest in music had great influence on his prose writing. Navarro suggests that readers of Carpentier's works are more listeners than they are readers. Lyrical use of colloquial dialects, literary rhythms such as alliteration and assonance and the theme of music within the world of the narrative (drums, footsteps, etc.) are a few examples of music's influence over Carpentier's work. In an interview the author himself was quoted as saying \"Music is present in all of my work.\" For Carpentier, analysis of Cuban identity was grounded in the analysis of Cuban music. As such, for Carpentier to better understand Cuban identity through his work, he eagerly integrated music into his writing.\n\nDoes he come from a cuban background?", "response": "Yes, Alejo Carpentier y Valmont comes from a Cuban background. Although he was born in Lausanne, Switzerland, he grew up in Havana, Cuba, and strongly self-identified as Cuban throughout his life.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_4454", "prompt": "Answer the following question. Which bird is also known as the 'Adjutant Bird'?", "response": "The bird commonly known as the 'Adjutant Bird' is the Greater Adjutant (Leptoptilos dubius), which is a large stork endemic to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It got its name “adjutant” from its upright and disciplined posture, which resembles a high-ranking military officer called an adjutant. This fascinating bird has a distinct appearance and is currently listed as an endangered species by the IUCN Red List.\n\nThe Greater Adjutant is among the heaviest of flying birds, weighing between 12 to 20 pounds (5.5 to 9 kilograms) and boasting an impressive wingspan that ranges from 8.2 to 9.2 feet (250 to 280 centimeters). It has a massive dark gray to blackish bill, a dark gray head covered with sparse grayish hair-like feathers, a pale iris, a reddish pouch hanging from the neck, and black legs. The body is covered in white and dark gray feathers, while its folded wings display a combination of black, gray, and white feathers.\n\nGreater Adjutants are usually found in wetlands, marshes, swamps, and sometimes along riverbanks and in large dumpsites. They prefer feeding on a variety of food, from fish and amphibians to small rodents, birds, reptiles, and carrion. These solitary birds have shown a high level of adaptability by adjusting their diet depending on the availability of local food sources.\n\nAn important aspect of the Greater Adjutant's life is its breeding behavior. They are colonial breeders, meaning they form nesting colonies with other storks during the breeding season. These nesting colonies are usually found in large trees. The female Greater Adjutant lays 2 to 4 wide, chalky-white eggs in a large nest made of sticks. Both parents share incubation duties for about 28 to 35 days; they tend the chicks until they fledge at around 150 days.\n\nUnfortunately, the Greater Adjutant has faced a sharp decline in population due to habitat loss, poaching, and other anthropogenic factors. Wetland destruction, pollution, and conversion of land for agriculture have resulted in a reduced availability of suitable nesting and feeding sites. Additionally, the loss of nesting trees and increased human disturbance in nesting areas have made breeding more challenging. Consequently, conservation efforts are crucial in order to protect and conserve this unique and endangered species.\n\nIn recent years, some initiatives have been taken to raise awareness and conserve the remaining population of Greater Adjutants. These include habitat protection, nest monitoring, and community engagement programs. For instance, the conservation efforts by local communities in Assam, India, have helped stabilize the population and create a positive environment for these extraordinary birds. Through continued efforts and cooperation between governments, conservation organizations, and local communities, it is hoped that the Greater Adjutant will have a chance to rebound and thrive in its natural habitat.", "token_count": 512}

The Tiled Kiosk was built in 1472.\n2. It was built for Mehmet the Conqueror.\n3. The building is decorated with turquoise and blue tile.\n4. It is the most eye-catching building in the square.\n\nTaking each fact into account, we can draw some logical conclusions:\n\nFact 1: The Tiled Kiosk was built in 1472, indicating a specific time period during which arts, architecture, and culture might have been valued and appreciated. Mehmet the Conqueror, who ruled the Ottoman Empire from 1444 to 1446 and again from 1451 to 1481, was indeed known for his patronage of the arts and his interests in beautifying the empire with architectural wonders.\n\nFact 2: The Tiled Kiosk was built for Mehmet the Conqueror, implying that its construction was commissioned by or intended for him in some capacity. It can be inferred that as the ruler of the Ottoman Empire at that time, Mehmet likely had direct or indirect influence over its design, location, and overall concept. Since a ruler generally commissions buildings and works of art that reflect their tastes and preferences, it is plausible to assume that the Tiled Kiosk was appreciated by Mehmet the Conqueror.\n\nFact 3: The building is decorated with turquoise and blue tile, which demonstrates a distinct aesthetic choice. These colorful and intricately designed tiles were a hallmark of Ottoman architecture and a symbol of status and sophistication. This suggests that not only did Mehmet appreciate the visual appeal of the Tiled Kiosk, but he also wanted it to be an exemplary representation of Ottoman art and architecture.\n\nFact 4: The Tiled Kiosk is the most eye-catching building in the square, which further supports the idea that Mehmet the Conqueror may have intended for it to be an impressive and admired structure, one that would capture the attention of visitors and locals alike.\n\nWhile there may not be direct evidence or historical records stating that Mehmet the Conqueror explicitly appreciated the Tiled Kiosk, based on the available information and noteworthy details of its construction and design, we can reasonably conclude that the hypothesis \"The Tiled Kiosk was appreciated by Mehmet the Conqueror\" is likely true.", "token_count": 512}

{"id": "example_2350", "prompt": "Q:I read this background article the other day: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.  Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  I am facing a new situation today: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot.

I found two relevant pieces of information in the text: The author mentioned that they ate dinner with their parents and that they never stopped when they talked with their friend.\n\n4. I then reasoned that the phrase \"never stopped\" when they talked with their friend implies that there was a continuous conversation between the author and their friend throughout the evening.\n\n5. However, the text does not specifically mention if the author continued talking while eating, as it only mentioned dinner with the parents.\n\n6. To answer the question, I concluded that although the author maintained a continuous conversation with their friend, there isn't enough information in the text to confirm whether the author spoke continually while eating.\n\nSo my final answer is: There isn't enough information to determine if the author spoke continually while eating.", "token_count": 320}

It is led by members of the British West Indian community, and attracts around one million people annually, making it one of the world's largest street festivals, and a significant event in British culture. In 2006, the UK public voted it onto the list of icons of England. Despite its name, it is not part of the global Carnival season preceding Lent.  - The Elim Pentecostal Church is a UK-based Pentecostal Christian denomination.  - Portobello Road is a street in the Notting Hill district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in west London. It runs almost the length of Notting Hill from south to north, roughly parallel with Ladbroke Grove. On Saturdays it is home to Portobello Road Market, one of London's notable street markets, known for its second-hand clothes and antiques. Every August since 1996, the Portobello Film Festival has been held in locations around Portobello Road.  - Kensington Temple is a large Pentecostal church in the Notting Hill area of London , England . It is pastored by Reverend Colin Dye , and is the largest church in its denomination , the Elim Pentecostal Church .  - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations  often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties  are sometimes known as \"branches of Christianity\" or \"denominational families\".  - Notting Hill is an affluent district in West London, located north of Kensington within the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea as well as Westminster. Notting Hill is known for being a cosmopolitan neighbourhood, hosting the annual Notting Hill Carnival and Portobello Road Market.  - Carnival (see other spellings and names) is a Western Christian festive season that occurs before the liturgical season of Lent. The main events typically occur during February or early March, during the period historically known as Shrovetide (or Pre-Lent). Carnival typically involves a public celebration and/or parade combining some elements of a circus, masks, and a public street party. People wear masks and costumes during many such celebrations, allowing them to lose their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity. Excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods proscribed during Lent is extremely common. Other common features of carnival include mock battles such as food fights; social satire and mockery of authorities; the grotesque body displaying exaggerated features, especially large noses, bellies, mouths, and phalli, or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms.

{"id": "example_812", "prompt": "Background: Lester Willis Young (August 27, 1909 - March 15, 1959), nicknamed \"Pres\" or \"Prez\", was an American jazz tenor saxophonist and occasional clarinetist. Coming to prominence while a member of Count Basie's orchestra, Young was one of the most influential players on his instrument. In contrast to many of his hard-driving peers, Young played with a relaxed, cool tone and used sophisticated harmonies, using what one critic called \"a free-floating style, wheeling and diving like a gull, banking with low, funky riffs that pleased dancers and listeners alike\". Known for his hip, introverted style, he invented or popularized much of the hipster jargon which came to be associated with the music.\nContext: In 1933 Young settled in Kansas City, where after playing briefly in several bands, he rose to prominence with Count Basie. His playing in the Basie band was characterized by a relaxed style which contrasted sharply with the more forceful approach of Coleman Hawkins, the dominant tenor sax player of the day. One of Young's key influences was Frank Trumbauer, who came to prominence in the 1920s with Paul Whiteman and played the C-melody saxophone (between the alto and tenor in pitch).  Young left the Basie band to replace Hawkins in Fletcher Henderson's orchestra. He soon left Henderson to play in the Andy Kirk band (for six months) before returning to Basie. While with Basie, Young made small-group recordings for Milt Gabler's Commodore Records, The Kansas City Sessions. Although they were recorded in New York (in 1938, with a reunion in 1944), they are named after the group, the Kansas City Seven, and comprised Buck Clayton, Dicky Wells, Basie, Young, Freddie Green, Rodney Richardson, and Jo Jones. Young played clarinet as well as tenor in these sessions. Young is described as playing the clarinet in a \"liquid, nervous style.\"  As well as the Kansas City Sessions, his clarinet work from 1938-39 is documented on recordings with Basie, Billie Holiday, Basie small groups, and the organist Glenn Hardman. Billie and Lester met at a Harlem jam session in the early 30s and worked together in the Count Basie band and in nightclubs on New York's 52nd St. At one point Lester moved into the apartment Billie shared with her mother, Sadie Fagan. Holiday always insisted their relationship was strictly platonic. She gave Lester the nickname \"Prez\" after President Franklin Roosevelt, the \"greatest man around\" in Billie's mind. Playing on her name, he would call her \"Lady Day.\" Their famously empathetic classic recordings with Teddy Wilson date from this era.  After Young's clarinet was stolen in 1939, he abandoned the instrument until about 1957. That year Norman Granz gave him one and urged him to play it (with far different results at that stage in Young's life--see below).\nQuestion: What other bands was Billie in?\n\nAnswer:", "response": "Billie Holiday, also known as Lady Day, was a famous jazz singer who performed with various bands throughout her career.

She also wrote poems about the struggles of black women. But her skill was more than her ability to write about struggling black people. She combined traditional European poetry styles with the African American experience. Gwendolyn Brooks once said that she wrote about what she saw and heard in the street. She said she found most of her materials through looking out of the window of her second-floor apartment in Chicago, Illinois. In her early poetry, Gwendolyn Brooks wrote about the South Side of Chicago, where many black people live. In her poems, the South Side is called Bronzeville. It was \"A Street in Bronzeville\" that gained the attention of literary experts in 1945. Critics praised her poetic skills and her powerful descriptions about the black experience during the time. The Bronzeville poems were her first published collection. In 1950, Gwendolyn Brooks became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for Literature.

The problem provides the quantity of each letter in the set: l:1, v:3, f:5, c:1. We need to find the probability of picking 1 v, 1 l, and 2 f letters.\n\nPart #2: Understand the concept of probability and solving without replacement.\nUsage: The probability of an event occurring is calculated as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, since we are picking without replacement, the number of possible outcomes will decrease with each pick.\n\nPart #3: Calculate the number of favorable outcomes and total possible outcomes.\nUsage: We can calculate the probability as follows:\n\n- Picking 1 v: There are 3 v's out of 10 total letters, so the probability is 3/10.\n- Picking 1 l: There are 1 l's out of the remaining 9 letters, so the probability is 1/9.\n- Picking 2 f's: For the first f, there are 5 f's out of the remaining 8 letters, so the probability is 5/8. For the second f, there are 4 f's out of the remaining 7 letters, so the probability is 4/7.\n\nPart #4: Calculate the probability of the event.\nUsage: Multiply the probabilities of each event:\n(3/10) * (1/9) * (5/8) * (4/7) = 60/5040\n\nPart #5: Simplify and present the result in the appropriate format.\nUsage: The simplified probability is 1/84, which meets the criteria of a fractional number (numerator and denominator separated by a forward slash).", "token_count": 512}

The two passersby, intrigued by the spectacle, decide to assist the lady in her task of distributing the freebies. They realize that by working together as a team, they can create more fun for the dog and make better use of the freebies, which appear to be promotional items from a nearby event.\n\nAs the group collaborates, other park-goers start to take notice of the commotion and begin to gather around. This draws the attention of a man seated on a nearby bench, who appears to have a large supply of additional freebies. He approaches the lady and the passersby, offering to replenish their stock as they continue with their impromptu event. Grateful for the extra assistance, the lady collects more freebies, promptly distributing them to her newfound helpers.\n\nAs the lady, the two passersby, and the man work in tandem, a jovial atmosphere envelops the park. Children witnessing the scene plead with their parents to let them join in on the fun, and before long, a crowd begins to form. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves, effortlessly tossing the freebies for the dog, who in turn persistently proves its fetching prowess.\n\nIn the midst of the excitement, a few people move to the walkway adjacent to the park, from where they use their mobile phones to capture photographs and videos to share on social media, documenting the spontaneous event. Bursting with enthusiasm, they begin to share their experiences with friends, inviting them to join in the lively activity unfolding at the park.\n\nAs more and more onlookers join the fun and engage with one another, a sense of camaraderie and cheerfulness arises.

{"id": "example_12232", "prompt": "Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Imagine picking apples on Christmas or going skating on May Day. What about going for a swim on Thanksgiving? Without Leap Day ,which takes place every four years, that could happen. Our calendar is normally 365 days long. It was created to match the cycles of the seasons. But Roman ruler Julius Caesar noticed a problem: The earth doesn't circle the sun in exactly 365 days. It actually cakes 365 and one-quarter days. He figured out that the extra part of a day would cause the calendar to grow apart from the seasons over time. Over 100 years, the seasons would shift  about 24 days. Spring would start on April 13 instead of March 20. Caesar used math to figure out a way to stop the calendar from shifting. He decided to add an extra day to the month of February every four years. His idea helped keep the seasons and calendar matched up. Even so, it still wasn't perfect--his calendar was adding too many days. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII worked on Caesar's idea. His calendar, called the Gregorian calendar, declares that every year that is equally divided by 400 is a leap year. Turn-of-the-century years, or years ending in \"00\", would not be leap years unless they could be divided equally by 400. These complicated equations help keep the calendar in balance with the orbit of the earth. Today, we still use the Gregorian calendar. In about 3,000 years, the calendar will be only one day out of step with the seasons, It's still not perfect, but mathematicians decided it was as close as we could get.\nA:", "response": "A: What is the primary reason for having Leap Day in our calendar system?\n1.

{"id": "example_4933", "prompt": "The softening of Scottish economic performance - much of it driven by the weakness in the oil and sector, though probably not all - has barely registered in the campaign.\nThat may be because the worst appears to be over - or the best, if you're an oil consumer, and most of us are.\nThe price per barrel of global benchmark Brent Crude ended April just above $47. Since dipping briefly below $30 in January, it has risen by nearly two-thirds.\nThat sounds a lot. And it is. But it's worth remembering that the price is down by 30% on this time last year, and by 60% on its most recent peak, in June 2014.\nSo what's going on, and what does it tell us about the future direction of travel?\nLast month saw members of OPEC, the cartel of major oil exporters, fail to agree on a way of limiting production so as to push prices up.\nIt looks to some, such as Oxford Economics, as if the cartel is dead. Or like the Norwegian blue parrot, it's resting. That is partly because two big players, Saudi Arabia and Iran, have a growing regional rivalry. It is also because non-OPEC members have much more influence on prices than used to be the case.\nThe price could have plummeted with that April failure to agree a freeze on production levels. But it didn't. It barely stumbled, and then continued its rising trend. Now, oil industry analysts are pointing to a continuing upside to the price. The boss of the International Energy Agency was the most recent to do so, commenting over the weekend.\nOPEC is next due to meet again in Vienna on June 2. But having ridden out the last failure to agree, and with prices rising despite that, there is less pressure to do a deal.\nThe Saudis left little doubt that their decision in late 2014 to retain production levels in order to sustain market share was intended to drive their new US rivals out of production.\nShale oil had followed on the shale gas boom in the USA. It helps explain why the country's crude oil production rose 57% between 2012 and 2015.\nBut the nature of a shale well is that it depletes in up to a couple of years, and then the reservoir has to be re-fracked.\nThere are only around half the shale rigs drilling in the US than there were a year ago. The low price has meant that it's not been worth going after more. Indeed, US shale drillers are in a lot of financial distress.\nSupply remains one million to two million barrels per day more than demand. The fall of US output should help ease back on that over-supply. It represents more than half of the 700,000 barrels per day decline in non-OPEC output expected this year.\nBut America's frackers are ready to come back, if the price does. They will probably start doing so at around $55. The International Energy Agency estimates that Texas and the Dakotas kick back in at $60 to $65, and could then take a year or so to return to steady production.\nBefore then, a rising price will lead to the release into the market of large stocks of oil that have been built up in the past 18 months. Commercial reserves in the OECD more developed nations, according to the International Energy Agency, stand at more than three billion barrels.\nThat $60 to $70 range is seen as the most likely one for the price to stabilise, at least for a while.\nBack in the heart of OPEC, around the Persian Gulf, Iran is determined to ignore the cartel's pressure to keep total supply suppressed.\nHaving been allowed to export since January, the Tehran government wants to get back to what it was producing before sanctions were imposed in 2011, and a bit more.\nIt was then at 3.5m barrels per day, and according to industry analysis from Platt's consultancy, it's nearly back to that level. It has stated that it wants to average 4m barrels per day this year.\nMuch of that is currently going to refineries in India and South Korea.  It has recently become easier to insure tankers sailing out of Iran, meaning it will play a more significant role in supplying Europe in coming months.\nThat's out of more than 95 million barrels produced globally each day, more than 10m of them from Saudi Arabia. which is part of more than 32m from OPEC countries. That OPEC figure is reckoned by Reuters surveying to have crept up again in April, helping to explain a fall in price at the start of the first, low-volume trading day of May. (If it helps get a sense of scale, the UK's output of oil and its gas equivalent has risen recently to 1.5m barrels per day.)\nIraq is also ramping up post-war production, reaching 4.16m barrels per day in March.\nBut some other countries are seeing it fall. Nigeria has disruptions from vandalism and attacks on its infrastructure.\nVenezuela's economy is in dire straits and Libya faces a civil war, so both have seen output cut by a shortage of power necessary to operate production plants. Oil extraction requires a lot of energy.\nThen there's the demand side of the imbalance. Last year saw demand growth strengthen a bit, having dipped with the stalling of emerging market growth.\nA more recent analysis from the IEA suggests that it is continuing to rise to 1.2m barrels per day more this year. That's a slower rate of rise than the back end of 2015, as China, Europe and the US demand eases. But while it's rising, it helps close the gap between demand and supply and get the market more balanced again.\nAnd there's another factor - the mighty greenback. The US dollar has weakened by around 6% against a basket of currencies since the start of the year, and that helps drive up the cost of a dollar-denominated commodity.\nWhat about the longer term? In a brave bit of forecasting, Edinburgh-based Wood Mackenzie energy consultancy last week put out a warning of a huge, 4.5m barrels per day supply shortage. That, it suggested, could be with us in 2035.\nThe reasoning for this is that the industry has become much less effective, or lucky, at finding new oil reserves.\nEven before the price slump cut exploration budgets by 40 to 50%, the annual discoveries of liquid reserves of hydrocarbons fell by roughly half between 2008 and 2015. The average year has seen around eight billion barrels of oil found.  Last year, it was less than three billion.\nA much harder calculation is how much demand there will be if the world's oil users are to meet their commitments to climate change targets.\nIf governments are true to their word, with written agreement of the Paris accord signed in the past few days, and if technology helps renewable power replace fossil fuels, the oil market 19 years from now may look very different\nWhat is a summary of this text?", "response": "In the oil industry, many factors are influencing the global market and future direction. The failure of OPEC to limit production and the rivalry between major players, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, have led to less pressure to reach a deal. US shale production has played a significant role, with the nature of shale wells requiring re-fracking to maintain production levels. Supply remains higher than demand, and the decline in non-OPEC output is expected to ease, with US frackers returning to the market as oil prices rise. Large stocks of oil are built up and are likely to be released into the market as prices rise. The demand side of the equation has recently been influenced by the stalling of emerging market growth, and the weakening USD has driven up the cost of the dollar-denominated commodity. In the long term, the industry's ability to find new oil reserves has been less successful, and the commitment to climate change targets adds uncertainty to the future of oil markets.\n\nIn summary, the oil industry faces numerous challenges and influences from both production and demand sides, with rivalries within OPEC, US shale production, weakening USD, and the global commitment to climate change creating an uncertain environment for the market.", "token_count": 512}
{"id": "example_7962", "prompt": "Ethiopia Hits Somali Targets, Declaring War\nEthiopia, which commands the region’s most powerful military, did not disclose how many troops, tanks or planes it had sent into Somalia, but the United Nations has said at least 8,000 Ethiopian soldiers may be in the country. Casualties were reported Sunday, but reliable estimates were impossible to ascertain.\n\nUntil now, Ethiopian officials had denied that they had any combat forces inside Somalia, saying instead that their involvement was limited to a few hundred military advisers.\n\nOver the past few months, the Islamist clerics in Somalia have threatened Ethiopia for supporting their rivals, the internationally recognized transitional government.\n\nOn Saturday, after several days of heavy internal fighting, Islamist leaders announced that Somalia was now open to Muslim fighters around the world who wanted to wage a holy war against Ethiopia, a country with a long Christian history, even though it is about half Muslim.\n\n“What did you expect us to do?” said Zemedkun Tekle, a spokesman for Ethiopia’s information ministry. “Wait for them to attack our cities?”\n\nEven before Ethiopia’s escalation on Sunday, there were alarming signs that the conflict in Somalia could quickly spiral out of control. According to United Nations officials, at least 2,000 soldiers from Eritrea, which recently waged war with Ethiopia, are fighting for the Islamists. They have been joined by a growing number of Muslim mercenaries from Yemen, Egypt, Syria and Libya who want to turn Somalia into the third front of holy war, after Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nOn Friday, residents of Mogadishu said they saw boatloads of armed men landing on the city’s rocky beaches. On Sunday, after the bombings, Islamist leaders boasted of bringing in more. Still, from the Ethiopian government’s viewpoint, the bombings may be delivering at least some of the desired effect.\n\nFor the first time since the Islamists came to power in Somalia in June and rapidly began expanding their reach, they seemed to be losing ground. In at least three places on Sunday — Idaale, Jawil and Bandiiradley — transitional government troops were pushing the Islamists back.\n\nResidents of Beledweyne, near the Ethiopian border, said that after the Ethiopian jets pounded several armed pickup trucks belonging to the Islamists, the rest of the Islamist soldiers fled to the hills.\n\nThe bombs also destroyed a recruitment center and a fuel depot, killing at least 10 people, witnesses reported. Hours later, the transitional troops marched into the area, and a new mayor was installed.\n\nMany of Beledweyne’s people seemed relieved, not so much about the change in government, but because the fighting appeared to have ended so fast.\n\n“We’re so sick of war,” said Ahmed Issa, a shopkeeper in Beledweyne. “We’ll obey anybody.”\n\nMuch of Somalia has been mired in anarchy since 1991, when the central government collapsed, setting off a long, nasty interclan war. While the United Nations and donor countries struggled to get a new government on its feet, a grass-roots movement of Islamic courts began to gain power.\n\nAfter Islamist leaders defeated the last of Mogadishu’s warlords, they immediately restored a sense of law and order unheard of in the capital for 15 years. Then they began pushing outward, eventually reaching the outskirts of Baidoa, the seat of the transitional government.\n\nThe transitional government has never been popular, and its military forces are divided between rival politicians, many of whom spend the majority of their time outside of Somalia. This summer, Ethiopia began slipping soldiers across the border to protect both the transitional government and Ethiopia itself.\n\nThe Islamists had threatened to liberate Somali-speaking areas of Ethiopia and stir up Ethiopia’s Muslim population.\n\nAmerican officials acknowledged that they tacitly supported Ethiopia’s approach because they felt it was the best way to check the growing power of the Islamists, whom American officials have accused of sheltering terrorists tied with Al Qaeda. A State Department spokesperson in Washington said Sunday that the United States was assessing reports of the surge in fighting in Somalia but provided no further comment.\n\nA major question going forward seems to be whether Ethiopian forces will advance into Mogadishu and try to finish off the Islamist military, a possibility that many fear could spur a long and ugly insurgency, or simply deal the Islamists enough of a blow to force them back to negotiations with the transitional government.\n\nThe rival authorities in Somalia have flirted with the idea of sharing power, but several rounds of peace talks have produced little but broken promises.\n\nIn a hint of a possible direction to come, Ethiopia’s prime minister recently told American officials that he could wipe out the Islamists “ in one to two weeks.”\n\nBut many analysts fear that the presence of Ethiopian troops in Somalia will only make matters worse, because of the history of conflict between Ethiopians and Somalis. The two nations have battled over contested border areas before, and the difference of religions, with Somalia almost purely Muslim, has often been an aggravating factor.\n\nOn Sunday, as word began to spread that Ethiopian planes were bombing Somalia, students in Mogadishu rushed into the streets and began rioting. They kicked in doors and smashed plate glass windows, yelling at the few shopkeepers still open: “This is not time for business! This is time for war!”\n\nThe Islamists are using teenagers as their main fighting force. Last week, right after heavy combat began between the Islamist troops and the transitional government forces, Islamist leaders closed all schools in Mogadishu to funnel more young people into battle.\n\nWitnesses in frontline areas have said that waves of young, poorly trained Islamist fighters have been mowed down by Ethiopian troops. Ethiopia’s military is trained by American advisers and is supplied with millions of dollars of American aid.\n\nOn Sunday, Abdulrahim Ali Modei, the Islamists’ information minister, conceded at a news conference that many of the Islamist troops had been killed, but he did not sound discouraged.\n\n“These are victories,” he said. “Our soldiers are in paradise now.”\n\nYussuf Maxamuud and Mohammed Ibrahim contributed reporting from Mogadishu, Somalia.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Ethiopia Hits Somali Targets, Declaring War.

There are fears that the conflict could spiral out of control, with Eritrean soldiers and Muslim mercenaries from other nations joining the fight to turn Somalia into a new front for a holy war.

That's when the major changes, including the health insurance exchanges ramp up and the Medicaid expansion occurs. Because there has been such a long time between when things started and now, there are plenty of misconceptions about what's happened, what's going on, and what will occur. For instance, just a month ago, a poll found that 4 in 10 Americans were unsure about whether Obamacare still existed. About a quarter didn't know or didn't answer. An additional 7% thought that the Supreme Court had overturned it last year. Another 12% thought that it had been repealed by Congress and is no longer a law.\n\nWidespread belief in this might help", "response": "explain why there is still so much confusion and misinformation surrounding the Affordable Care Act. The misconceptions are fueled by a combination of factors, including political rhetoric, media coverage, and a general lack of understanding about the complexities of the healthcare system.\n\nFirstly, political rhetoric has played a significant role in shaping public opinion on the Affordable Care Act. Since its inception, the law has been embroiled in a heated partisan debate, with Republicans denouncing it as a government takeover of healthcare, while Democrats defend it as a necessary step toward universal coverage. This divide has often overshadowed the actual provisions of the law, leading many Americans to form opinions based on their political leanings rather than on a complete understanding of the legislation.\n\nThe media has also contributed to the widespread confusion about the Affordable Care Act. News reports often focus on the political battles surrounding the law, rather than the law itself. Moreover, coverage tends to emphasize the most controversial aspects of the legislation, such as the individual mandate and the employer requirements, neglecting the more positive changes brought about by the law, such as the requirement for insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions and the expansion of Medicaid coverage to millions of low-income Americans.\n\nAnother contributing factor to the misconceptions about the Affordable Care Act is the lack of understanding of the complexities of the healthcare system itself. Navigating the US healthcare system can be confusing even for well-informed individuals, let alone those who are just beginning to learn about insurance and the way it works. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act is a massive piece of legislation that includes numerous provisions, some of which have yet to be implemented. This complexity makes it difficult for many people to grasp the full scope of the law and what it means for them.\n\nThe confusion surrounding the Affordable Care Act can have serious consequences for both its supporters and detractors. If people are unsure about whether the law still exists or what its provisions are, they may not take advantage of the benefits it offers, such as premium tax credits or Medicaid expansion. Additionally, misinformation about the law has the potential to perpetuate negative stereotypes and uninformed criticisms, making it more challenging to have a productive conversation about healthcare reform in the United States.\n\nIn summary, widespread belief in the nonexistence or repeal of the Affordable Care Act can help explain the confusion and misconceptions many Americans still have about the law. This confusion can largely be attributed to factors such as political rhetoric, media coverage, and the complexity of the healthcare system itself. Moving forward, it will be crucial to provide accurate information about the law and its provisions to ensure that all Americans can make informed decisions about their healthcare coverage and participate in the ongoing discussion surrounding healthcare reform.", "token_count": 512}

The film opens with the narrator (who is also the film's director) driving out West along a desert highway, relating to the audience his previous experiences as a streetside bookseller in New York City. The entire documentary – including the central events involving his experiences among the street booksellers in New York – is thus \"told\" as a long conversation. The narrator describes his post-graduation years in New York, and how he ended up at one point virtually penniless. Driven by a desperate need to pay the rent, he resorts to wheeling his own books out to the street to try to sell them. He reveals that he was not only successful in making a significant amount of cash on that first day, but he has also met a variety of interesting and strange characters of the streets of New York – including other street booksellers. A motley assortment of street booksellers on West 4th street, in Greenwich Village, New York City, are first introduced. Among them: \"Slick\" Rick Sherman, a semi-professional magician; Al Mappo, so named because he only sells maps and atlases; Emil, who says only he \"escaped\", though we do not know from where; and Pete Whitney: King of the booksellers, toad collector, and collage artist. BookWars next introduces another group of street booksellers who hawk their trade on nearby 6th Avenue. Mainly black and minority individuals, they ply books and magazines in parallel fashion to the nearby West 4th street booksellers, who are primarily white. The booksellers on 6th Avenue suffer greater exposure to the law, with many claiming this to be due to racial profiling.

{"id": "example_10216", "prompt": "A gratitude journal is useful for cultivating gratitude on a daily basis. Write in your journal each day, either morning or night (or both!).  Start with 5 things that you are grateful for each day. The activity of using a journal makes the practice of gratitude intentional and conscious each day. It's also a great way to look back on your life and see where you were at during different points in your life.  Waking up in the morning and writing in your gratitude journal can jumpstart your day and keep you in joyful anticipation, or combat feelings of dread. Journaling at the end of the day can close out your day with feelings of contentment as you go to bed. For more information, check out How to Start a Gratitude Journal. Maybe keeping a journal sounds like too much work or effort. Instead, you can find time throughout the day to acknowledge the things you are grateful for. Silently acknowledge the big and little things in your life daily.  For example, think of one thing in the morning, another at lunch, and one at bedtime. Wear a bracelet every day and remind yourself that each time you see it, you think of something you are grateful for. While this sounds counter-intuitive, think back to a difficult period in your life. Perhaps you went through a difficult breakup, a traumatic event, or the death of a loved one. Now reflect on the fact there here you are, able to look back on that as a memory. You successfully overcame that difficult period of life and you have what it takes to get through dark moments.   Write in your journal about a challenging time you went through. Recall what it felt like, and what got you through the difficult time. Note the strengths and personal attributes you utilized to get through it. Perhaps you're going through another even darker time now. By looking back on difficult situations, you can reflect that you found your way out of the dark then, and you can do it again. While depression can make you feel like everything is in a negative light, expressing gratitude can help you see the silver lining. Think about three good things that have happened in the last week. Then, explain why those things happened. This practice can help you change that negative fog into a more positive approach.  For example, one good thing could be, “My dog greeted me at the door every day this week.” For the explanation, you can say, “My dog loves me and he is excited to see me every day when I get home. This fills me with happiness, even when I feel down.” Another example: “I was nervous about making my deadline, but I made it on time. I put in a lot of work and even though I felt stressed, I finished on time. This made me feel good and accomplished.” . Mindfulness meditation often involves focusing your attention on one thing (such as “peace” or “calm”). While practicing meditation, tune your focus onto gratitude. Let any thoughts you have float out of your awareness and bring your attention back to gratitude.   Choose one thing that you feel grateful for and meditate on it. This can be a warm sunny day, a delicious meal, a hug from a child, or a beautiful painting. Practice feeling gratitude for your relationships. Focus on one person at a time, like your mother, father, grandparent, partner or spouse, or child. Focus on the feeling of gratitude you have for this person being in your life.\n\nSummary:", "response": "A gratitude journal is like a special notebook where you write down things you are thankful for every day.

When you remember hard times and how you got through them, it helps you feel strong and able to handle tough situations.

The flight lasted 49 hours, 26 minutes and 8 seconds. Today the jet is on permanent static display at Denver International Airport's Terminal C.  A month before he died, Conrad appeared on ABC News Nightline and said, \"I think the Space Shuttle is worth one billion dollars a launch. I think that it is worth two billion dollars for what it does. I think the Shuttle is worth it for the work it does.\" In the last interview he gave before his death, Conrad sat down for PBS's Nova series and discussed where he felt the future direction of space travel should go. He considered returning to the Moon \"a waste of taxpayer money\", but recommended missions to Mars and asteroids.

He led efforts to explore new opportunities for private companies to invest in space-based research, satellite launches, and human spaceflight.\n\n3. Public Speaking and Advocacy: Throughout the 1990s, Conrad was a sought-after public speaker, sharing his experiences as an astronaut, test pilot, and aerospace executive. He advocated for the continued exploration of space and encouraged young people to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\n\n4. Philanthropy and Charitable Causes: Conrad was actively involved in charitable organizations and initiatives during the 1990s. He used his fame and influence to raise funds and awareness for various causes, such as education, health, and environmental conservation.\n\n5. Personal Projects: In his personal life, Conrad remained an aviation enthusiast and often flew his own planes in various air shows and events. He also mentored young pilots and continued his lifelong passion for flight.\n\nIn summary, Charles \"Pete\" Conrad was an influential and active figure in the aerospace community and beyond throughout the 1990s.

However, there are some considerations and assumptions that you need to take into account to reach this conclusion. \n\nFirst, you have to assume that the phrase \"it did look much better with another one above it\" refers to Sam's drawing. Second, you have to take into account the relative positioning of the drawings; Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's. The given information does not directly refer to yet another drawing above Sam's drawing, the interpretation is made under the premise that when it's said \"with another one above it\", it was considering that Sam's drawing had Tina's drawing beneath it and thus, had another drawing complementing or contrasting it.\n\nIn this scenario, when you say, \"another one,\" it is inferred that there's another drawing, apart from Tina’s, which hasn't been explicitly mentioned but is implied to exist and is assumed to have been above Sam’s drawing. It can be seen as the reason why Sam's drawing looked much better. However, this phrasing can be ambiguous and it could also be interpreted as Sam's drawing looking better when positioned above Tina's drawing.\n\nIn the end, the distinction might not matter if the focus of the conclusion is the enhanced aesthetic value of Sam's drawing when it is bracketed by another piece of artwork. Even so, the positioning and specific identity of the artwork that goes above Sam's drawing are variables that need further clarification. However, based on the provided sentence, it's reasonable to conclude that \"Sam's drawing did look much better with another one above it.\" But it should be noted that this conclusion is likely situational, and the effect might vary depending on the specific pieces of art involved.", "token_count": 429}

But there was no sign of the accused serial polyandrist. \n  \n The woman who has allegedly skipped out on 10 marriages in an immigration scam also skipped Monday’s proceeding, and now is a runaway bride, Brennan reported. The warrant was issued in a result. \n  \n Barrientos, 39, was charged last month with filing with a false instrument, claiming she was married 10 times since 1999 without divorcing some of her previous husbands. \n  \n Prosecutors said at her arraignment last month that she has a record of marrying foreign nationals. \n  \n Barrientos married Mohamed Gerbil in November 1999, Ahmed Allam in November 2001, Habibur Rahman also in November 2001, Davit Koridze in February 2002, Duran Goktepe in March 2002, Aliaksandr Paharelau also in March 2002, Vakhtang Dzneladze in May 2002, Rashid Rajput in July 2002, Kakhaber Khorbaladze in August 2002, and Salle Keita in March 2010, prosecutors alleged. \n  \n “Seven of the men used the marriage to file for legal assistant resident status with immigration, and we found out when some of them were denied, they filed for divorce immediately and refiled for their immigration status with other marriages,” said Bronx Assistant District Attorney Jessica Lupo. \n  \n Prosecutors said Barrientos and the husbands filed for marriage licenses all over the New York metro area, including Westchester and Rockland counties and Long Island. \n  \n Prosecutors said Barrientos would make subtle changes to her name on the applications, and local authorities said towns take applicants at their word. \n  \n Court papers said Barrientos is currently married to four men, and some of the 10 were from so-called “red-flagged countries.” One of them has been kicked out after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. \n  \n “One of the men was put into removal by the Joint Terrorism Task Force investigation regarding making threatening statements towards the U.S. and was deported,” Lupo said. \n  \n That man was groom No. 8, Rashid Rajput, who was deported to Pakistan, prosecutors alleged. \n  \n After appearing in court last month on the charges stemming from the alleged multiple marriages, Barrientos was arrested for allegedly jumping the turnstile at a Bronx subway station. \n  \n Police alleged Barrientos and her 19-year-old niece, Tracy Barrientos, walked through the emergency gate at the subway station at East 149th Street and Grand Concourse, sources told CBS2. \n  \n Liana Barrientos was arraigned a second time on April 10 on a new charge of theft of service, and was released without any bail being set, CBS2 reported.

Is the review positive or negative?\nThe answer is:", "response": "The review is negative. \n\nThe review provides several clues that point towards a negative sentiment. Firstly, the reviewer describes the product as \"rather drying\". In most contexts, especially in beauty, personal care, and cleaning products, 'drying' has a negative connotation. It often implies that the product makes the user's skin feel dry, which is usually an undesirable effect.\n\nNext, the reviewer describes the scent of the product, stating that it \"isn't great.\" This is also an indicator of their dissatisfaction with the product. A 'great' smell is typically essential to a good user experience, particularly in sectors like beauty, personal care, and cleaning products. Thus, not having a satisfactory scent contributes to their negative sentiment.\n\nThe reviewer then expresses disappointment because they were expecting the \"green tea scent would come thru more\". This demonstrates the product did not meet their expectations in terms of fragrance intensity or quality, adding to the negative sentiment.\n\nFinally, the statement \"used it once and won't again\" clearly expresses the reviewer's unwillingness to reuse the product, suggesting they were extremely dissatisfied with it.\n\nTherefore, given these factors, this can be concluded as a negative review. The reviewer's language and feedback do not indicate any positive feelings or satisfaction with the product, and they express disappointment and dissatisfaction in multiple ways.

{"id": "example_428", "prompt": "Please answer the following question: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller.  Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff.  But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.  Warner’s committee is also investigating possible... Question: Generally, how long does individual testimony before a congressional committee usually last? Options: - several hours   - many months   - not enough information   - a few weeks === The correct answer is\nAnswer:", "response": "Individual testimony before a congressional committee usually lasts several hours. The length of the testimony can vary depending on the complexity of the subject matter, the importance of the testimony, and whether the person testifying is cooperative or evasive. However, it is important to note that the entire congressional investigation or hearing may span weeks or even months, but individual testimonies are typically confined to a matter of hours.", "token_count": 512}
{"id": "example_8677", "prompt": "Write a question about the following article: The Livonian War  was fought for control of Old Livonia , when the Tsardom of Russia faced a varying coalition of Denmark-Norway, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Union  of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland. During the period 1558-1578, Russia dominated the region with early military successes at Dorpat  and Narva. Russian dissolution of the Livonian Confederation brought Poland-Lithuania into the conflict, while Sweden and Denmark both intervened between 1559 and 1561. Swedish Estonia was established despite constant invasion from Russia, and Frederick II of Denmark bought the old Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek, which he placed under the control of his brother Magnus of Holstein. Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian vassal state Kingdom of Livonia, which nominally existed until his defection in 1576. In 1576, Stefan Batory became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania and turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish-Polish-Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland-Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland-Lithuania. The following year, Sweden and Russia signed the Truce of Plussa with Sweden gaining most of Ingria and northern Livonia while retaining the Duchy of Estonia.\n\nQuestion about the article:", "response": "What were the key events and outcomes of the Livonian War, particularly in relation to the involvement of Denmark-Norway, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Union of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, and the Tsardom of Russia?", "token_count": 439}

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep.

Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop.
